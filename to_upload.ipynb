        "# Sentiment Analysis using bag of words\n",
        "This model focuses completely on the words, or sometimes a string of words, but usually pays no attention to the \"context\" so-to-speak. The bag of words model usually has a large list, probably better thought of as a sort of \"dictionary,\" which are considered to be words that carry sentiment. These words each have their own \"value\" when found in text. The values are typically all added up and the result is a sentiment valuation. The equation to add and derive a number can vary, but this model mainly focuses on the words, and makes no attempt to actually understand language fundamentals.\n",

 \\nimdb,\"Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!  \"\\nyelp,\"Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.\"\\nyelp,So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.\\nyelp,\"I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.\"\\namazon,the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.\\nyelp,We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.\\nimdb,\"Either way, it sucks.  \"\\namazon,\"What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...\"\\namazon,All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.\\nimdb,The best example of how dumb the writing is when it\\'s established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  \\nimdb,\"This gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there\\'s nothing lower.  \"\\namazon,Poor Talk Time Performance.\\nimdb,One of the worst shows of all time.  \\namazon,\"All in all, I\\'m quite satisfied with this purchase.\"\\nimdb,\"Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.  \"\\nyelp,The inside is really quite nice and very clean.\\namazon,If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.\\nimdb,\"The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they\\'re 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  \"\\nyelp,I\\'m not really sure how Joey\\'s was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.\\namazon,\"But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.\"\\nimdb,A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  \\nimdb,But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  \\nimdb,Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.  \\nyelp,Waitress was a little slow in service.\\namazon,I am glad I purchased it.\\nimdb,\"However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  \"\\nyelp,Good Service-check!\\nyelp,If you haven\\'t gone here GO NOW!\\nyelp,And it was way to expensive.\\nyelp,\"It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.\"\\nyelp,Food was really boring.\\nyelp,Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.\\nimdb,add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  \\nyelp,\"Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!\"\\nyelp,How awesome is that.\\nyelp,Never again will I be dining at this place!\\nimdb,\"Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  \"\\nimdb,The acting was bad.  \\nyelp,\"The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.\"\\nimdb,Awful.  \\nyelp,\"the food is not tasty at all, not to say its \"\"real traditional Hunan style\"\".\"\\nimdb,Highly recommended A+  \\namazon,I\\'ve tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this Jabra one is the first one I\\'ve found that fits my ear comfortably.\\nyelp,Everything was fresh and delicious!\\nimdb,\"Ray Charles\\' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  \"\\namazon,The design is very good.4.\\namazon,I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.\\nimdb,The kids are annoying.  \\namazon,I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.\\namazon,The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.\\namazon,Great bluetooth!.\\nyelp,- the food is rich so order accordingly.\\nimdb,No plot whatsoever!  \\nyelp,There was hardly any meat.\\nyelp,Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.\\namazon,\"Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.\"\\nimdb,Really awful.  \\nyelp,\"It\\'s like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you\\'re outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.\"\\nyelp,The patio seating was very comfortable.\\nyelp,Awful service.\\nimdb,\"Then, there\\'s the plot holes.  \"\\nyelp,The service was extremely slow.\\nyelp,\"The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.\"\\nimdb,The directing and the cinematography aren\\'t quite as good.  \\nimdb,Sam Shepard\\'s portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  \\namazon,I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.\\nimdb,\"The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  \"\\nyelp,\"Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.\"\\nyelp,\"One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn\\'t expect more tip than that.\"\\nimdb,The worst one of the series.  \\nyelp,\"Good value, great food, great service.\"\\nyelp,My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.\\nyelp,\"After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.\"\\namazon,\"My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!\"\\nimdb,The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  \\nimdb,\"However, this didn\\'t make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  \"\\nyelp,\"Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.\"\\namazon,\"The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.\"\\namazon,im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there\\'s not much reviews about it.\\namazon,Does not fit.\\namazon,This phone is pretty sturdy and I\\'ve never had any large problems with it.\\nyelp,will definitely be back!\\nyelp,This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\nimdb,The result is a film that just don\\'t look right.  \\nimdb,\"The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won\\'t spoil it.  \"\\namazon,This is by far the worst purchase I\\'ve made on Amazon.\\nyelp,I went to Bachi Burger on a friend\\'s recommendation and was not disappointed.\\nimdb,\"Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  \"\\namazon,So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.\\namazon,The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone\\'s front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.\\namazon,I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!\\nyelp,Reasonably priced also!\\nimdb,All of the main players are mesmerising.  \\nyelp,This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.\\nimdb,The story line is just awful!  \\nyelp,This was like the final blow!\\nimdb,\"I just cant explain this movie more than romantic,charming,hilarious,and adorable.The junkyard scenes are funny,all the junkyard dogs have something special.Too funny i laughed,kids will LOVE it.Buy it when it comes out,it has new features!  \"\\nimdb,\"It\\'s quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  \"\\nimdb,The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  \\namazon,Excellent product.\\nimdb,The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.  \\nyelp,\"I\\'ve had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.\"\\nyelp,\"To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.\"\\nyelp,\"It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.\"\\namazon,The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.\\nimdb,Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  \\namazon,This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.\\nimdb,\"Very true to Shakespear, and a \\'must\\' for all Shakespear fans.  \"\\namazon,This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.\\namazon,\"I\\'ve only had my bluetooth for a few weeks, but I really like it.\"\\nimdb,It deserves strong love.  \\namazon,I\\'ve had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me.\\namazon,Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.\\nyelp,Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.\\nyelp,Both great!\\namazon,Great choice!\\nyelp,At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.\\nimdb,\"Avoid, avoid, avoid!  \"\\nyelp,The pizza selections are good.\\nyelp,This is a good joint.\\namazon,Great for using with your home stereo.\\nimdb,\"I\\'m a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice\\'s style, sensitivities and treatments.  \"\\namazon,It was a great phone.\\namazon,\"I only used it two days, and it wasn\\'t always easy to hear with.\"\\namazon,That company is a joke.\\nimdb,Here\\'s where the movie really pi**ed me off.  \\namazon,\"Provides good protection and looks classy, too.\"\\nimdb,\"However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  \"\\nimdb,The acting is beyond abysmal.  \\nyelp,\"What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.\"\\namazon,\"This is a good battery, and it got here really fast.\"\\namazon,The delivery was on time.\\namazon,Also the area where my unit broke).- I\\'m not too fond of the magnetic strap.\\nimdb,\"Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene).  \"\\namazon,none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.\\namazon,The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.\\nimdb,The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  \\nimdb,Don\\'t waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  \\namazon,Does Not Work.\\namazon,Disappointed with battery.\\namazon,Nice docking station for home or work.\\namazon,\"During several different 2 minute calls, I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars.\"\\nyelp,I never come again.\\nimdb,I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  \\namazon,This fixes all the problems.\\namazon,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE.\\nimdb,\"Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  \"\\nimdb,This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  \\nimdb,\"This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can\\'t handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  \"\\nyelp,The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.\\nyelp,The block was amazing.\\nimdb,It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  \\nimdb,\"I saw \"\"Mirrormask\"\" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  \"\\nimdb,I was deeply impressed with the character he played.  \\nyelp,\"Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.\"\\nyelp,The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.\\namazon,This is the phone to get for 2005....

Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.  \\namazon,Thank you for such great service.\\nyelp,The chefs were friendly and did a good job.\\namazon,I Was Hoping for More.\\nimdb,I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  \\nimdb,Even worse than Ticker!

you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.  \"\\nimdb,\"The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I\\'ve ever seen.  \"\\nimdb,Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.  \\nimdb,Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  \\nimdb,It\\'s one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90\\'s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  \\nimdb,\"Again, lame.  \"\\nimdb,Glad I didn\\'t pay to see it.  \\nimdb,But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.  \\nimdb,\"At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn\\'t.  \"\\nimdb,Exceptionally bad!  \\nimdb,\"But the convoluted plot just didn\\'t convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  \"\\nimdb,\"But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.  \"\\nimdb,At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  \\nimdb,\"But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn\\'t translate to quality, that\\'s for sure.  \"\\nimdb,When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  \\nimdb,\"It\\'s a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.  \"\\nimdb,\"The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  \"\\nimdb,\"I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this \"\"film\"\".  \"\\nimdb,NOBODY identifies with these characters because they\\'re all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  \\nimdb,To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  \\nimdb,My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  \\nimdb,\"Regrettably, the film fails.  \"\\nimdb,\"This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  \"\\nimdb,\"To sum the film up, \"\"Breeders\"\" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.  \"\\nimdb,\"Wow, what a bad film.  \"\\nimdb,\"Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.  \"\\nimdb,& That movie was bad.  \\nimdb,\"IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it\\'s time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  \"\\nimdb,That was done in the second movie.  \\nimdb,Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  \\nimdb,Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  \\nimdb,In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn\\'t work for me at all.  \\nimdb,Wasted two hours.  \\nimdb,\"There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe\\'s glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe\\'s facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.  \"\\nimdb,\"Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, \"\"you see kids...\"\" Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.  \"\\nimdb,The script is horrendously stupid.  \\nimdb,One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  \\nimdb,I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.  \\nimdb,All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  \\nimdb,There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  \\nimdb,Final Word: This Show is a real torture!!  \\nimdb,Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.  \\nimdb,\"The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  \"\\nimdb,\"A truly, truly bad film.  \"\\nimdb,The directing seems too pretentious.  \\nimdb,\"But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  \"\\nimdb,Summary: The witticisms weren\\'t witty.  \\nimdb,Avoid at any and all costs.  \\nimdb,\"The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  \"\\nimdb,\"Top line: Don\\'t waste your time and money on this one, its as bad as it comes.  \"\\nimdb,I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  \\nimdb,The football scenes at the end were perplexing.  \\nimdb,\"It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  \"\\nimdb,DELETE this film from your mind!  \\nimdb,Avoid this film at all costs.  \\nimdb,The only thing worse than Taylor\\'s acting was Stanwyck\\'s singing.  \\nimdb,Now this is a movie I really dislike.  \\nimdb,There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  \\nimdb,\") very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.  \"\\nimdb,\"Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  \"\\nimdb,Even the squibs look awful.  \\nimdb,The script is\\xc2\\x85was there a script?  \\nimdb,The character developments also lacked in depth.  \\nimdb,\"Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  \"\\nimdb,This movie is BAD.  \\nimdb,Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  \\nimdb,How awful she is!  \\nimdb,\"It didn\\'t make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.  \"\\nimdb,The story is beyond stupid.  \\nimdb,The characters were very \\'stagey\\' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  \\nimdb,It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  \\nimdb,I was very disappointed in the movie.  \\nimdb,The visual effects were AWFUL.  \\nimdb,All in all its an insult to one\\'s intelligence and a huge waste of money.  \\nimdb,End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I\\'ve ever seen.  \\nimdb,This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  \\nimdb,1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  \\nimdb,The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.  \\nimdb,I\\'m translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  \\nimdb,\"Not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.  \"\\nimdb,It\\'s so bad it\\'s actually worth seeing just for that reason.  \\nimdb,\"The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv\\'s diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  \"\\nimdb,there is no real plot.  \\nimdb,The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  \\nimdb,\"The sets are so bad, they wouldn\\'t look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  \"\\nimdb,There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  \\nimdb,\"I don\\'t understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it\\'s not even a real movie!  \"\\nimdb,The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  \\nimdb,\"A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  \"\\nimdb,It is not good.  \\nimdb,The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  \\nimdb,You\\'d have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  \\nimdb,If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  \\nimdb,\"I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  \"\\nimdb,The concert sequences just sucked.  \\nimdb,Also the story and acting were weak.  \\nimdb,Everything about this movie is stupid.  \\nimdb,I literally vomited while watching this film.  \\nimdb,\"Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  \"\\nimdb,\"If this premise sound stupid, that\\'s because it is.  \"\\nimdb,\"The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???  \"\\nimdb,The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  \\nimdb,But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  \\nimdb,The film looks cheap and bland.  \\nimdb,I mean this in a terrible way.  \\nimdb,\"Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  \"\\nimdb,I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  \\nimdb,\"This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  \"\\nimdb,\"In a word, it is embarrassing.  \"\\nimdb,\"In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  \"\\nimdb,The plot is nonsense that doesn\\'t interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.  \\nimdb,I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  \\nimdb,And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  \\nimdb,\"I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.  \"\\nimdb,\"Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.  \"\\nimdb,\"These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  \"\\nimdb,It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I\\'d have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  \\nimdb,Avoid at ALL costs!  \\nimdb,What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  \\nimdb,Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  \\nimdb,I couldn\\'t take them seriously.  \\nimdb,\"About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  \"\\nimdb,Horrible!  \\nimdb,The directing is sloppy at best.  \\nimdb,\"There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn\\'t understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  \"\\nimdb,\"If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.  \"\\nimdb,\"And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would\\'ve been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  \"\\nimdb,Too politically correct.  \\nimdb,\"I wasn\\'t expecting Oscar material, but this?  \"\\nimdb,Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.  \\nimdb,The jerky camera movements were also annoying.  \\nimdb,A bit predictable.  \\nimdb,(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.  \\nimdb,\"Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  \"\\nimdb,I wasn\\'t the least bit interested.  \\nimdb,The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  \\nimdb,I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!  \\nimdb,From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  \\nimdb,\"This is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.  \"\\nimdb,The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  \\nimdb,Highly unrecommended.  \\nimdb,\"Let\\'s start with all the problems\\xc2\\x97the acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  \"\\nimdb,\"It\\'s an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  \"\\nimdb,Filmiing was less expansive.  \\nimdb,I\\'m so sorry but I really can\\'t recommend it to anyone.  \\nimdb,Watching washing machine twirling around wouldn\\'t hurt your eyes as much as this show.  \\nimdb,The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  \\nimdb,\"I\\'m glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn\\'t do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It\\'s gonna help movie makers who aren\\'t in the very restrained \"\"movie business\"\" of Qu\\xc3\\xa9bec.  \"\\nimdb,There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  \\nimdb,I never walked out of a movie faster.  \\nimdb,He surely doesn\\'t know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  \\nimdb,\"By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.  \"\\nimdb,\"I know that Jim O\\'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  \"\\nimdb,You can find better movies at youtube.  \\nimdb,THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  \\nimdb,\"How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it\\'s ALL wrong.  \"\\nimdb,This is definitely one of the bad ones.  \\nimdb,\"Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  \"\\nimdb,\"The plot doesn\\'t hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  \"\\nimdb,\"Lewis Black\\'s considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won\\'t allow.  \"\\nimdb,Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.  \\nimdb,\"His co-stars don\\'t fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  \"\\nimdb,This one just fails to create any real suspense.  \\nimdb,\"Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  \"\\nimdb,This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  \\nimdb,An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  \\nimdb,\"Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  \"\\nimdb,\"The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that\\'s how bad it is.  \"\\nimdb,One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  \\nimdb,There\\'s also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  \\nimdb,\"The \"\"explosion\"\" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.  \"\\nimdb,\"Another thing I didn\\'t really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  \"\\nimdb,It\\'s a case of \\'so bad it is laughable\\'.  \\nimdb,\"This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn\\'t have even been created.  \"\\nimdb,\"Aside from it\\'s terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  \"\\nimdb,I can\\'t believe there\\'s even a sequel to this!  \\nimdb,So bad...well...it\\'s just bad.  \\nimdb,\"This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  \"\\nimdb,\"Only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations MAYBE, & poor hummh!  \"\\nimdb,The poor actors.  \\nimdb,Then the film just dropped the ball.  \\nimdb,But even the talented Carrell can\\'t save this.  \\nimdb,I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I\\'d spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  \\nimdb,The least said about the acting the better.  \\nimdb,\"At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  \"\\nimdb,\"Worse, there\\'s an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who\\'s working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  \"\\nimdb,I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don\\'t believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  \\nimdb,\"Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.  \"\\nimdb,\"Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  \"\\nimdb,It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  \\nimdb,The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  \\nimdb,That\\'s how I\\'d describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.  \\nimdb,The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God\\'s sake!  \\nimdb,The lead man is charisma-free.  \\nimdb,\"Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  \"\\nimdb,It will drive you barking mad!  \\nimdb,It is shameful.  \\nimdb,It\\'s a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  \\nimdb,I thought it was bad.  \\nimdb,Nothing new there.  \\nimdb,I am a fan of his ... This movie sucked really bad.  \\nimdb,\"In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  \"\\nimdb,But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn\\'t really work for their freedom.  \\nimdb,\"first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  \"\\nimdb,I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  \\nimdb,\"He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  \"\\nimdb,Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  \\nimdb,There were too many close ups.  \\nimdb,\"Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  \"\\nimdb,\"On the negative, it\\'s insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  \"\\nimdb,\"You can\\'t relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  \"\\nimdb,\"Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.  \"\\nimdb,The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  \\nimdb,\"This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn\\'t work here.  \"\\nimdb,The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.  \\nimdb,I was left shattered from the experience of watching this \\'film\\' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  \\nimdb,\"The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80\\'s flicks.  \"\\nimdb,\"Often the dialogue doesn\\'t really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  \"\\nimdb,The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  \\nimdb,\"The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  \"\\nimdb,\"It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  \"\\nimdb,If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  \\nimdb,This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.  \\nimdb,I hate movies like that.  \\nimdb,\"He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  \"\\nimdb,\"Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  \"\\nimdb,What the hell kind of crap is that?!  \\nimdb,I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  \\nimdb,Started watching this but didn\\'t believe in any of the characters.  \\nimdb,\"The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  \"\\nimdb,It\\'s very slow.  \\nimdb,\"1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  \"\\nimdb,\"All in all, a great disappointment.  \"\\nimdb,The most annoying thing about \\'Cover Girl\\' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  \\nimdb,\"So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I\\'ve seen.  \"\\nimdb,This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  \\nimdb,Very little music or anything to speak of.  \\nimdb,The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.  \\nimdb,Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  \\nimdb,\"It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  \"\\nimdb,\"I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  \"\\nimdb,It\\'s like a bad two hour TV movie.  \\nimdb,But it wasn\\'t anything at all just one big yawn...  \\nimdb,\"Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  \"\\nimdb,Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  \\nimdb,\"Again, no plot at all.  \"\\nimdb,I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  \\nimdb,Not recommended.  \\nimdb,\"Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  \"\\nimdb,\"Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  \"\\nimdb,\"A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clich\\xc3\\xa9s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.  \"\\nimdb,The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.  \\nimdb,It just blew.  \\nimdb,There aren\\'t death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  \\nimdb,i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  \\nimdb,\"Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.  \"\\nimdb,None of them are engaging or exciting.  \\nimdb,\"The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  \"\\nimdb,\"Of course, the acting is blah.  \"\\nimdb,Lots of holes in the script.  \\nimdb,I\\'ll even say it again \\xc2\\x96 this is torture.  \\nimdb,You can\\'t even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  \\nimdb,The dialogue sucked.  \\nimdb,Very disappointing.  \\nimdb,The guy who said he\\'s had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  \\nimdb,Why was this film made?  \\nimdb,\"Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I\\'m not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  \"\\nimdb,This movie is terrible.  \\nimdb,Not recommended.  \\nimdb,The flat reenactments don\\'t hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  \\nimdb,20th Century Fox\\'s ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  \\nimdb,Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  \\nimdb,I really don\\'t see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  \\nimdb,If you check the director\\'s filmography on this site you will see why this film didn\\'t have a chance.  \\nimdb,the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  \\nimdb,) Don\\'t waste your time.  \\nimdb,The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  \\nimdb,What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  \\nimdb,The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  \\nimdb,I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  \\nimdb,My rating: just 3 out of 10.  \\nimdb,Dee Snider just plain sucks.  \\nimdb,The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen\\'t bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn\\'t care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  \\nimdb,\"There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn\\'t really work into the rest of the plot.  \"\\nimdb,Hated it.  \\nimdb,The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  \\nimdb,But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  \\nimdb,\"So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  \"\\nimdb,\"Even Billy Bob couldn\\'t rise above the script, which was worse.  \"\\nimdb,Rating: 1 out of 10.  \\nimdb,It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.  \\nimdb,\"He really didn\\'t seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn\\'t get involved with the guests.  \"\\nimdb,By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn\\'t care what happened next and so I switched off.  \\nimdb,This may be the only bad film he ever made.  \\nimdb,\"With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  \"\\nimdb,\"It was forced, like everything in this movie.  \"\\nimdb,I don\\'t think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  \\nimdb,In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  \\nimdb,Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  \\nimdb,\"The plot - well, I said I\\'d let that one go.  \"\\nimdb,Everything about it is just bad.  \\nimdb,Nothing at all to recommend.  \\nimdb,Didn\\'t laugh or even smile once.  \\nimdb,Really bad.  \\nimdb,Not easy to watch.  \\nimdb,This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.  \\nimdb,\"A Lassie movie which should have been \"\"put to sleep\"\".... FOREVER.  \"\\nimdb,So bad.  \\nimdb,Lot of holes in the plot: there\\'s nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  \\nimdb,\"Otherwise, don\\'t even waste your time on this.  \"\\nimdb,\"But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  \"\\nimdb,\"Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  \"\\nimdb,\"If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  \"\\nimdb,His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  \\nimdb,This was a flick doomed from its conception.  \\nimdb,I paid too much.  \\nimdb,This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.  \\nimdb,\"If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you\\'re gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  \"\\nimdb,It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  \\nimdb,Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  \\nimdb,\"I\\'m terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  \"\\nimdb,\"The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  \"\\nimdb,\"I am so tired of clich\\xc3\\xa9s that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.  \"\\nimdb,\"This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  \"\\nimdb,Lame would be the best way to describe it.  \\nimdb,\"It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  \"\\nimdb,I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  \\nimdb,Today the graphics are crap.  \\nimdb,\"The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  \"\\nimdb,The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  \\nimdb,About half way through this film I started to dislike it.  \\nimdb,\"Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie \"\"Grim\"\", clearly doesn\\'t know how to pace his films.  \"\\nimdb,\"Seriously, it\\'s not worth wasting your, or your kid\\'s time on.  \"\\nimdb,And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  \\nimdb,Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  \\nimdb,\"Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  \"\\nimdb,\"The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they\\'re delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  \"\\nimdb,\"It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.  \"\\nimdb,\"Long, whiny and pointless.  \"\\nimdb,I\\'m not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  \\nimdb,Omit watching this.  \\nimdb,This is not movie-making.  \\nimdb,The dialogue is atrocious.  \\nimdb,\"It probably would have been better if the director hadn\\'t spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn\\'t that noteworthy.  \"\\nimdb,\"To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it\\'s your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it\\'s in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  \"\\nimdb,\"putting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa\\'s character.  \"\\nimdb,The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  \\nimdb,The budget was evidently very limited.  \\nimdb,\"As for the killer, don\\'t expect anything original or even remotely frightening.  \"\\nimdb,\"Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.  \"\\nimdb,\"Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  \"\\nimdb,\"Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  \"\\nimdb,I\\'ve seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  \\nimdb,But it\\'s just not funny.  \\nimdb,\"I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  \"\\nimdb,The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  \\nimdb,\"I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  \"\\nimdb,\"Woa, talk about awful.  \"\\nimdb,All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  \\nimdb,The story line is totally predictable.  \\nimdb,Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  \\nimdb,It was so BORING!  \\nimdb,Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  \\nimdb,There were several moments in the movie that just didn\\'t need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  \\nimdb,The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  \\nimdb,\"\"\" But \"\"Storm Trooper\"\" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.  \"\\nimdb,\"The script is bad, very bad \\xc2\\x96 it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.  \"\\nimdb,This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  \\nimdb,The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  \\nimdb,This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  \\nimdb,\"Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  \"\\nimdb,Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  \\nimdb,The script is a big flawed mess.  \\nimdb,\"Unless you\\'re just out to visually \"\"collect\"\" all extant films of Austen\\'s work, you can skip this one.  \"\\nimdb,\"Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  \"\\nimdb,It was just too horrible.  \\nimdb,The lighting is awful.  \\nimdb,\"Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  \"\\nimdb,\"Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.  \"\\nimdb,\"Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  \"\\nimdb,I\\'m still trying to get over how bad it was.  \\nimdb,\"Camerawork - again, bad.  \"\\nimdb,About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  \\nimdb,\"Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  \"\\nimdb,\"And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  \"\\nimdb,\"It\\'s dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  \"\\nimdb,There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  \\nimdb,\"The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it\\'s about emptiness, it works I guess because it\\'s empty.  \"\\nimdb,\"Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  \"\\nimdb,It is zillion times away from reality.  \\nimdb,This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich\\xc3\\xa9s to be admitted elsewhere.  \\nimdb,I can\\'t see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  \\nimdb,\"But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as \"\"pretentious crap\"\".  \"\\nimdb,The movie seemed a little slow at first.  \\nimdb,It was horrendous.  \\nimdb,The soundtrack sucked.  \\nimdb,\"This was a poor remake of \"\"My Best Friends Wedding\"\".  \"\\nimdb,\"The results, well, are a shame.  \"\\nimdb,Everything stinks.  \\nimdb,It is an insane game.  \\nimdb,Now you know why I gave it a 10+!  \\nimdb,\"In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  \"\\nimdb,Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.  \\nimdb,This is high adventure at its best.  \\nimdb,\"Okay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I\\'ll give credit where credit\\'s due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  \"\\nimdb,\"If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne\\'s sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  \"\\nimdb,Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.  \\nimdb,The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.  \\nimdb,Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  \\nimdb,The film\\'s sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  \\nimdb,GO AND SEE IT!  \\nimdb,I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  \\nimdb,\"It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  \"\\nimdb,\"I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973, when it was \"\"The Stranger\"\" and I loved it.  \"\\nimdb,I rate this movie 9/10.  \\nimdb,The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  \\nimdb,I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.  \\nimdb,\"Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  \"\\nimdb,\"Yet, I enjoy watching it.  \"\\nimdb,It\\'s one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!  \\nimdb,\"Gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!  \"\\nimdb,\"(My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.  \"\\nimdb,\"An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  \"\\nimdb,\"Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  \"\\nimdb,\"I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  \"\\nimdb,\"If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of \"\"The Way You Look Tonight\"\"), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  \"\\nimdb,\"Still, it was the SETS that got a big \"\"10\"\" on my \"\"oy-vey\"\" scale.  \"\\nimdb,\"Funny, clever, hip - just like Pray\\'s previous film, Hype!  \"\\nimdb,This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  \\nimdb,The camera really likes her in this movie.  \\nimdb,It\\'s hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  \\nimdb,\"The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  \"\\nimdb,\"Predictable, but not a bad watch.  \"\\nimdb,\"The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture\\'s disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it\\'s distorted interpretations of fame.  \"\\nimdb,The movie is not completely perfect but \\'Titta Di Girolamo\\' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  \\nimdb,I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  \\nimdb,\"The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.  \"\\nimdb,\"Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.  \"\\nimdb,The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  \\nimdb,\"This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  \"\\nimdb,\"Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.  \"\\nimdb,\"However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film \"\"about\"\" Mishima that is both superb & complex.  \"\\nimdb,But in terms of the writing it\\'s very fresh and bold.  \\nimdb,\"But it is entertaining, nonetheless.  \"\\nimdb,\"steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy.  \"\\nimdb,The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  \\nimdb,How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  \\nimdb,\"Totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.  \"\\nimdb,\"If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  \"\\nimdb,You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  \\nimdb,\"The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I\\'ve seen.  \"\\nimdb,\"Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  \"\\nimdb,The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  \\nimdb,\") some great music, and terrific scenery.  \"\\nimdb,\"The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn\\'t make it.  \"\\nimdb,I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.  \\nimdb,But this movie really got to me.  \\nimdb,\") What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.  \"\\nimdb,is pretty funny.  \\nimdb,\"There is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).  \"\\nimdb,\"The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.  \"\\nimdb,Her role was played well.  \\nimdb,That was nice.  \\nimdb,\"For people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job!!  \"\\nimdb,\"This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it\\'s not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  \"\\nimdb,\"At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar\\'s CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  \"\\nimdb,\"I have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.  \"\\nimdb,\"Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  \"\\nimdb,All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola\\'s roeg wih a sublime cast.  \\nimdb,I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.  \\nimdb,\"The ending is so, SO perfect... you\\'ll shed a tear.  \"\\nimdb,The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  \\nimdb,\"In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  \"\\nimdb,Also notable is John Bailey\\'s fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola\\'s Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  \\nimdb,Ursula Burton\\'s portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  \\nimdb,\"However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  \"\\nimdb,Great movie!  \\nimdb,It looked like a wonderful story.  \\nimdb,\"Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in \"\"At Play In The Fields Of The Lord\"\".  \"\\nimdb,You share General Loewenhielm\\'s exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  \\nimdb,Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  \\nimdb,The cast is good.  \\nimdb,The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.  \\nimdb,\"Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens\\' Christmas Carol in its sensibility.  \"\\nimdb,The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  \\nimdb,This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.  \\nimdb,\"Excellent cast, story line, performances.  \"\\nimdb,\"Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel\\'s discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer\\'s grasp in Huston\\'s portrayal.  \"\\nimdb,It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  \\nimdb,She\\'s poised and amazing.  \\nimdb,There still are good actors around!  \\nimdb,And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  \\nimdb,I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!  \\nimdb,Julian Fellowes has triumphed again.  \\nimdb,You won\\'t forget this movie!  \\nimdb,Three of the most visually appealing movies i\\'ve ever seen.  \\nimdb,\"I like Armand Assante & my cable company\\'s summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  \"\\nimdb,It was so funny.  \\nimdb,\"If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  \"\\nimdb,This if the first movie I\\'ve given a 10 to in years.  \\nimdb,I advise you to look out for it.  \\nimdb,\"I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  \"\\nimdb,\"Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  \"\\nimdb,\"The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn\\'t insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  \"\\nimdb,\"I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  \"\\nimdb,\"Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  \"\\nimdb,\"I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)  \"\\nimdb,Definitely worth seeing\\xc2\\x85 it\\'s the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  \\nimdb,\"The film\\'s dialogue is natural, real to life.  \"\\nimdb,;) Recommend with confidence!  \\nimdb,I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.  \\nimdb,PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.  \\nimdb,Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  \\nimdb,\"As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980\\'s and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.  \"\\nimdb,\"It\\'s just adorable seeing Mickey playing \"\"Turkey in the Straw\"\" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  \"\\nimdb,\"It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone\\'s terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  \"\\nimdb,Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.  \\nimdb,\"But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you\\'ll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  \"\\nimdb,A great film by a great director.  \\nimdb,Don\\'t miss it.  \\nimdb,\"I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez\\'s directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  \"\\nimdb,Brilliant!  \\nimdb,\"While you don\\'t yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  \"\\nimdb,The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  \\nimdb,\"Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock\\'s black and white, low-budget original.  \"\\nimdb,This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  \\nimdb,It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients\\' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).  \\nimdb,Conclusion - I loved it.  \\nimdb,This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  \\nimdb,Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  \\nimdb,\"The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the \"\"acting coach\"\" are fascinating.  \"\\nimdb,John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  \\nimdb,It\\'s PURE BRILLIANCE.  \\nimdb,The movie I received was a great quality film for it\\'s age.  \\nimdb,\"It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the \"\"gadget\"\".  \"\\nimdb,I will never forget it now.  \\nimdb,A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.  \\nimdb,Also great directing and photography.  \\nimdb,The movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!  \\nimdb,\"It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.  \"\\nimdb,Definitely worth checking out.  \\nimdb,\"This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.  \"\\nimdb,For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki\\'s films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.  \\nimdb,\"Plus, with the movie\\'s rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  \"\\nimdb,I have recommended it to friends.  \\nimdb,Up there with the best of Melville.  \\nimdb,Waste your money on this game.  \\nimdb,\"Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  \"\\nimdb,\"It\\'s a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  \"\\nimdb,This is an extraordinary film.  \\nimdb,Babie Bop is very cute.  \\nimdb,An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  \\nimdb,They could be used as exemplars for any set designer.  \\nimdb,Go rent it.  \\nimdb,I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  \\nimdb,\"I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  \"\\nimdb,Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  \\nimdb,\"Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.  \"\\nimdb,10 out of 10 stars.  \\nimdb,Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master\\'s stable.  \\nimdb,This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.  \\nimdb,But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  \\nimdb,\"Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  \"\\nimdb,This movie has a cutting edge to it.  \\nimdb,\"I found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.  \"\\nimdb,\"***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can\\'t) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  \"\\nimdb,\"I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  \"\\nimdb,This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films.  \\nimdb,This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.  \\nimdb,Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I\\'ve ever heard.  \\nimdb,Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  \\nimdb,\"There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it\\'s just a massive game.  \"\\nimdb,But I thought his acting was skilled.  \\nimdb,This is an excellent film.  \\nimdb,\"When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  \"\\nimdb,This movie is also revealing.  \\nimdb,Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  \\nimdb,This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  \\nimdb,\"This movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven\\'t seen before.  \"\\nimdb,This is the number one best TH game in the series.  \\nimdb,I didn\\'t realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.  \\nimdb,This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  \\nimdb,Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  \\nimdb,I gave it a 10  \\nimdb,I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  \\nimdb,\"It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.  \"\\nimdb,The kids are very cool too.  \\nimdb,I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.  \\nimdb,I enjoyed it.  \\nimdb,\"It was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce\\'s acclaimed novella \"\"The Dead.  \"\\nimdb,It was also the right balance of war and love.  \\nimdb,Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  \\nimdb,This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.  \\nimdb,\"Emily Watson\\'s character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.  \"\\nimdb,I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  \\nimdb,\"And I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa Aurv\\xc3\\xa5g being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn\\'t understand where he is, what he is doing and why.  \"\\nimdb,The characters are interesting and you really care for them.  \\nimdb,See both films if you can.  \\nimdb,Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.  \\nimdb,\"Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  \"\\nimdb,\"I left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  \"\\nimdb,\"They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  \"\\nimdb,\"An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I\\'d love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  \"\\nimdb,The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  \\nimdb,I liked this movie way too much.  \\nimdb,The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.  \\nimdb,\"It was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.  \"\\nimdb,\"The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  \"\\nimdb,Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  \\nimdb,All the characters in this film are tremendously well played.  \\nimdb,\"Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  \"\\nimdb,Excellent short film.  \\nimdb,\"But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman \\xc2\\x96 and totally believable because he is a great actor.  \"\\nimdb,\"\"\" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  \"\\nimdb,His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  \\nimdb,Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.  \\nimdb,The transfers are very good.  \\nimdb,\"And there wasn\\'t a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  \"\\nimdb,This movie is so awesome!  \\nimdb,I\\'ll give this film 10 out of 10!  \\nimdb,I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  \\nimdb,It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  \\nimdb,\"It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  \"\\nimdb,It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  \\nimdb,\"The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  \"\\nimdb,\"\"\" In fact, it\\'s hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  \"\\nimdb,\"Being a 90\\'s child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  \"\\nimdb,\"In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise\\'s attempt.  \"\\nimdb,\"The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.  \"\\nimdb,\"It\\'s as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master\\'s work.  \"\\nimdb,Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  \\nimdb,\"Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  \"\\nimdb,This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70\\'s.  \\nimdb,The aerial scenes were well-done.  \\nimdb,Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.  \\nimdb,\"The film gives meaning to the phrase, \"\"Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.  \"\\nimdb,There is a brilliant twist ending.  \\nimdb,\"Lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.  \"\\nimdb,\"I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.  \"\\nimdb,It was a long time that i didn\\'t see a so charismatic actor on screen.  \\nimdb,Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.  \\nimdb,\"Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  \"\\nimdb,Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  \\nimdb,I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  \\nimdb,Meredith M was better than all right.  \\nimdb,I sat riveted to the TV screen.  \\nimdb,\"It\\'s a sad movie, but very good.  \"\\nimdb,\"If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director\\'s ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  \"\\nimdb,And those baby owls were adorable.  \\nimdb,\"This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA\\'s finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  \"\\nimdb,\"The soundtrack wasn\\'t terrible, either.  \"\\nimdb,He\\'s a national treasure.  \\nimdb,Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else\\'s judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  \\nimdb,This film offers many delights and surprises.  \\nimdb,The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.  \\nimdb,\"Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  \"\\nimdb,A good commentary of today\\'s love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.  \\nimdb,\"As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  \"\\nimdb,There\\'s barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  \\nimdb,\"As a courtroom drama, it\\'s compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it\\'s frightening.  \"\\nimdb,\"The acting, as you\\'d expect from this cast, is top notch.  \"\\nimdb,The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  \\nimdb,\"It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  \"\\nimdb,Raw and sublimely moving.  \\nimdb,It has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.  \\nimdb,\"the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  \"\\nimdb,\"He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  \"\\nimdb,\"Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  \"\\nimdb,It even has its sweet moments.  \\nimdb,\"Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  \"\\nimdb,This game rocks.  \\nimdb,10/10  \\nimdb,\"I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  \"\\nimdb,The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  \\nimdb,\"Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  \"\\nimdb,\"The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  \"\\nimdb,\"I won\\'t spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  \"\\nimdb,\"This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  \"\\nimdb,\"I couldn\\'t think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  \"\\nimdb,Everything about this film is simply incredible.  \\nimdb,I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  \\nimdb,Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi\\'s best producers Scot Vandiver !  \\nimdb,Very nice and relaxing late night viewing.  \\nimdb,\"\"\" I love it.  \"\\nimdb,\"The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  \"\\nimdb,Definitely worth checking out.  \\nimdb,STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  \\nimdb,The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  \\nimdb,Totally believable.  \\nimdb,\"This is a very \"\"right on case\"\" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  \"\\nimdb,Still it\\'s quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  \\nimdb,\"Shot in the Southern California desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkins creates a film like no other.  \"\\nimdb,\"Some applause should be given to the \"\"prelude\"\" however.  \"\\nimdb,\"The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  \"\\nimdb,The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.  \\nimdb,\"When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from \"\"Don Giovanni\"\" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.  \"\\nimdb,It\\'s also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn\\'t missed a step going from silent to sound.  \\nimdb,\":) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  \"\\nimdb,An excellent performance from Ms.  \\nimdb,\"People who like European films and \"\"art movies\"\" will like this movie.  \"\\nimdb,\"The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  \"\\nimdb,\"After watching this film, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.  \"\\nimdb,Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.  \\nimdb,\"If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  \"\\nimdb,\") a happy, wonderful, feel good ending!  \"\\nimdb,\"But \"\"Tiny Toons\"\" kept the 90\\'s vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  \"\\nimdb,It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  \\nimdb,\"A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  \"\\nimdb,Hitchcock is a great director.  \\nimdb,And I really did find them funny.  \\nimdb,A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  \\nimdb,Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey\\'s best films even after 80 wonderful years.  \\nimdb,I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.  \\nimdb,It is a true classic.  \\nimdb,Brilliance indeed.  \\nimdb,\"I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.  \"\\nimdb,\"All things considered, a job very well done.  \"\\nimdb,It really created a unique feeling though.  \\nimdb,\"The point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.  \"\\nimdb,This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  \\nimdb,All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  \\nimdb,Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  \\nimdb,The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  \\nimdb,Simply beautiful.  \\nimdb,It\\'s a feel-good film and that\\'s how I felt when I came out of the cinema!  \\nimdb,Excellent performance.  \\nimdb,\"I don\\'t know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family\\'s memories.  \"\\nimdb,You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  \\nimdb,The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  \\nimdb,\"Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America\\'s own Imperial age.  \"\\nimdb,\"Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  \"\\nimdb,See it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.  \\nimdb,Think of the film being like a dream.  \\nimdb,10/10  \\nimdb,Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.  \\nimdb,\"\"\" With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can\\'t recommend this movie enough.  \"\\nimdb,\"It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  \"\\nimdb,\"Still, I do like this movie for it\\'s empowerment of women; there\\'s not enough movies out there like this one.  \"\\nimdb,You wont regret it!  \\nimdb,\"If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  \"\\nimdb,\"Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  \"\\nimdb,\"I\\'m glad the film didn\\'t go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  \"\\nimdb,The music in the film is really nice too.  \\nimdb,I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  \\nimdb,The cast is always entertaining as usual.  \\nimdb,\"A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.  \"\\nimdb,Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY).  \\nimdb,\"Also, it\\'s a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.  \"\\nimdb,Give this one a look.  \\nimdb,Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  \\nimdb,The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.  \\nimdb,Fans of the genre will be in heaven.  \\nimdb,\"Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  \"\\nimdb,Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.  \\nimdb,But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut\\'s biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR.  \\nimdb,His performance is simply genius.  \\nimdb,His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  \\nimdb,This is such a fun and funny movie.  \\nimdb,It\\'s still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  \\nimdb,This is actually a very smart movie.  \\nimdb,There is a lot of beautiful places.  \\nimdb,\"But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  \"\\nimdb,I don\\'t think you will be disappointed.  \\nimdb,A good film by a great director!  \\nimdb,\"Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  \"\\nimdb,It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.  \\nimdb,This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.  \\nimdb,It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  \\nimdb,\"Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn\\'t seem to be stocking them.  \"\\nimdb,There are some generally great things in it.  \\nimdb,\"He owns the film, just as Spacek owned \"\"Coal Miner\\'s Daughter\"\" and Quaid owned \"\"Great Balls of Fire.  \"\\nimdb,\"For that, it\\'s worth checking out.  \"\\nimdb,\"It\\'s practically perfect in all of them \\xc2\\x96 a true masterpiece in a sea of faux \"\"masterpieces.  \"\\nimdb,\"Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery\\'s noble brigand, Candace Bergen\\'s feisty heroine, John Huston\\'s wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly\\'s spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt\\'s \"\"Big Stick\"\".  \"\\nimdb,\"I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of \"\"wonder\"\") are the excerpts from his works.  \"\\nimdb,The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  \\nimdb,Barney is definitely super DE duper.  \\nimdb,I just saw this film and I recommend it.  \\nimdb,It is a really good show to watch.  \\nimdb,\"Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  \"\\nimdb,\"All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  \"\\nimdb,In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  \\nimdb,Not too screamy not to masculine but just right.  \\nimdb,A film not easily forgotten.  \\nimdb,\"I loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it\\'s share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  \"\\nimdb,Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  \\nimdb,The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  \\nimdb,\"I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  \"\\nimdb,\"I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child.  \"\\nimdb,I\\'d advise anyone to go and see it.  \\nimdb,\"He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  \"\\nimdb,The rest of the cast also play well.  \\nimdb,\"The writers were \"\"smack on\"\" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real.  \"\\nimdb,The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  \\nimdb,Lange had become a great actress.  \\nimdb,I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  \\nimdb,I rather enjoyed it.  \\nimdb,I really liked that.  \\nimdb,It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn\\'t fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  \\nyelp,Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!\\nyelp,\"The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn\\'t eat here again.\"\\nyelp,Overall I wasn\\'t very impressed with Noca.\\nyelp,\"Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.\"\\nyelp,Avoid at all cost!\\nyelp,The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.\\nyelp,\"The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.\"\\nyelp,I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.\\nyelp,We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.\\nyelp,Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.\\nyelp,dont go here.\\nyelp,\"The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.\"\\nyelp,Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.\\nyelp,Crostini that came with the salad was stale.\\nyelp,Will not be back.\\nyelp,\"If it were possible to give them zero stars, they\\'d have it.\"\\nyelp,\"I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won\\'t be back here, because it is a convenient location.\"\\nyelp,\"How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can\\'t properly cook a steak, I don\\'t understand!\"\\nyelp,it was a drive to get there.\\nyelp,Never going back.\\nyelp,We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.\\nyelp,The food was terrible.\\nyelp,Won\\'t go back.\\nyelp,\"I\\'d rather eat airline food, seriously.\"\\nyelp,I think not again\\nyelp,The selection was probably the worst I\\'ve seen in Vegas.....there was none.\\nyelp,Would not go back.\\nyelp,\"Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.\"\\nyelp,\"Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!\"\\nyelp,\"As much as I\\'d like to go back, I can\\'t get passed the atrocious service and will never return.\"\\nyelp,Total brunch fail.\\nyelp,\"Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.\"\\nyelp,\"The food is about on par with Denny\\'s, which is to say, not good at all.\"\\nyelp,I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!\\nyelp,\"Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.\"\\nyelp,Horrible - don\\'t waste your time and money.\\nyelp,Not good for the money.\\nyelp,I don\\'t recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.\\nyelp,I won\\'t try going back there even if it\\'s empty.\\nyelp,It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.\\nyelp,\"When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.\"\\nyelp,The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.\\nyelp,We\\'ll never go again.\\nyelp,Over rated.\\nyelp,My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.\\nyelp,\"Then, as if I hadn\\'t wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.\"\\nyelp,\"For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.\"\\nyelp,But then they came back cold.\\nyelp,The live music on Fridays totally blows.\\nyelp,-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.\\nyelp,Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.\\nyelp,\"The descriptions said \"\"yum yum sauce\"\" and another said \"\"eel sauce\"\", yet another said \"\"spicy mayo\"\"...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.\"\\nyelp,Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.\\nyelp,We\\'ve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.\\nyelp,I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.\\nyelp,The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.\\nyelp,I just wanted to leave.\\nyelp,She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.\\nyelp,We won\\'t be going back anytime soon!\\nyelp,I\\'ve never been treated so bad.\\nyelp,\"Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.\"\\nyelp,I\\'m not eating here!\\nyelp,I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.\\nyelp,\"The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.\"\\nyelp,\"By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn\\'t mind making it publicly and loudly known.\"\\nyelp,\"There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better\"\\nyelp,I give it 2 thumbs down\\nyelp,Hell no will I go back\\nyelp,\"I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.\"\\nyelp,\"For service, I give them no stars.\"\\nyelp,\"The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.\"\\nyelp,\"We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.\"\\nyelp,Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).\\nyelp,Ordered burger rare came in we\\'ll done.\\nyelp,\"This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.\"\\nyelp,I was VERY disappointed!!\\nyelp,We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.\\nyelp,I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.\\nyelp,\"As for the \"\"mains,\"\" also uninspired.\"\\nyelp,My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.\\nyelp,Thoroughly disappointed!\\nyelp,I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.\\nyelp,As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.\\nyelp,The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.\\nyelp,I will not be eating there again.\\nyelp,There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.\\nyelp,\"Now the burgers aren\\'t as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.\"\\nyelp,Just don\\'t know why they were so slow.\\nyelp,Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.\\nyelp,did not like at all.\\nyelp,The selection of food was not the best.\\nyelp,This one is simply a disappointment.\\nyelp,say bye bye to your tip lady!\\nyelp,The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!\\nyelp,2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !\\nyelp,It was way over fried.\\nyelp,A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!\\nyelp,Spend your money elsewhere.\\nyelp,- They never brought a salad we asked for.\\nyelp,I as well would\\'ve given godfathers zero stars if possible.\\nyelp,very tough and very short on flavor!\\nyelp,The warm beer didn\\'t help.\\nyelp,\"Friend\\'s pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.\"\\nyelp,I\\'ve had better bagels from the grocery store.\\nyelp,This is a disgrace.\\nyelp,The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.\\nyelp,Soggy and not good.\\nyelp,By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.\\nyelp,I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.\\nyelp,I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.\\nyelp,We\\'ve tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we\\'re done with them.\\nyelp,I can\\'t tell you how disappointed I was.\\nyelp,Weird vibe from owners.\\nyelp,Will not be back!\\nyelp,Disappointing experience.\\nyelp,Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.\\nyelp,\"The service was not up to par, either.\"\\nyelp,\"The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.\"\\nyelp,There is nothing authentic about this place.\\nyelp,Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.\\nyelp,\"I started this review with two stars, but I\\'m editing it to give it only one.\"\\nyelp,\"On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.\"\\nyelp,\"Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.\"\\nyelp,Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.\\nyelp,\"If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.\"\\nyelp,I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.\\nyelp,But now I was completely grossed out.\\nyelp,\"I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.\"\\nyelp,We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).\\nyelp,\"too bad cause I know it\\'s family owned, I really wanted to like this place.\"\\nyelp,The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.\\nyelp,The Burrittos Blah!\\nyelp,The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.\\nyelp,The service here leaves a lot to be desired.\\nyelp,This place is horrible and way overpriced.\\nyelp,\"Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I\\'m not inspired to go back.\"\\nyelp,\"It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.\"\\nyelp,The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.\\nyelp,Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?\\nyelp,It was not good.\\nyelp,No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.\\nyelp,\"This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.\"\\nyelp,It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.\\nyelp,I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.\\nyelp,The service was terrible though.\\nyelp,Service was slow and not attentive.\\nyelp,\"My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.\"\\nyelp,The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.\\nyelp,The kids play area is NASTY!\\nyelp,\"Probably never coming back, and wouldn\\'t recommend it.\"\\nyelp,Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.\\nyelp,I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.\\nyelp,If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.\\nyelp,Do not waste your money here!\\nyelp,\"like the other reviewer said \"\"you couldn\\'t pay me to eat at this place again.\"\"\"\\nyelp,Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.\\nyelp,Boy was that sucker dry!!.\\nyelp,walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.\\nyelp,I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.\\nyelp,This place deserves no stars.\\nyelp,\"On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.\"\\nyelp,Worst food/service I\\'ve had in a while.\\nyelp,We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn\\'t bring that either.\\nyelp,It was equally awful.\\nyelp,After all the rave reviews I couldn\\'t wait to eat here......what a disappointment!\\nyelp,\"Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.\"\\nyelp,A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.\\nyelp,Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!\\nyelp,\"It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.\"\\nyelp,this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco\\'s.\\nyelp,I probably won\\'t be coming back here.\\nyelp,Terrible management.\\nyelp,\"seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.\"\\nyelp,My gyro was basically lettuce only.\\nyelp,\"I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!\"\\nyelp,Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.\\nyelp,I took back my money and got outta there.\\nyelp,Waiter was a jerk.\\nyelp,I wasn\\'t really impressed with Strip Steak.\\nyelp,\"It was extremely \"\"crumby\"\" and pretty tasteless.\"\\nyelp,\"Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.\"\\nyelp,\"Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.\"\\nyelp,\"Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.\"\\nyelp,\"Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I\\'ve ever had.\"\\nyelp,\"Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.\"\\nyelp,I\\'ve lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I\\'ve stepped foot into this place.\\nyelp,Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.\\nyelp,\"I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn\\'t food.\"\\nyelp,I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!\\nyelp,I would not recommend this place.\\nyelp,\"The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.\"\\nyelp,If you are reading this please don\\'t go there.\\nyelp,\"The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.\"\\nyelp,\"not even a \"\"hello, we will be right with you.\"\"\"\\nyelp,first time there and might just be the last.\\nyelp,Appetite instantly gone.\\nyelp,The service here is fair at best.\\nyelp,\"This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!\"\\nyelp,\"It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.\"\\nyelp,I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.\\nyelp,Won\\'t ever go here again.\\nyelp,The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.\\nyelp,The service was poor and thats being nice.\\nyelp,This place should honestly be blown up.\\nyelp,The service was meh.\\nyelp,The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.\\nyelp,I waited and waited.\\nyelp,The fried rice was dry as well.\\nyelp,This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.\\nyelp,We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.\\nyelp,My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.\\nyelp,\"At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn\\'t that busy.\"\\nyelp,This place is disgusting!\\nyelp,We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn\\'t fresh.\\nyelp,\"Sadly, Gordon Ramsey\\'s Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.\"\\nyelp,\"Will never, ever go back.\"\\nyelp,\"I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it\\'s so terrible!?!\"\\nyelp,Must have been an off night at this place.\\nyelp,\"The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.\"\\nyelp,\"Strike 2, who wants to be rushed.\"\\nyelp,\"I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.\"\\nyelp,They dropped more than the ball.\\nyelp,I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.\\nyelp,the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.\\nyelp,The waiter wasn\\'t helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.\\nyelp,Worst martini ever!\\nyelp,\"Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!\"\\nyelp,\"Overall, I don\\'t think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.\"\\nyelp,There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.\\nyelp,Which are small and not worth the price.\\nyelp,AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!\\nyelp,Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don\\'t want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I\\'ll leave it at that...\\nyelp,And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.\\nyelp,\"After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.\"\\nyelp,We aren\\'t ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don\\'t get it...definitely lost the love after this one!\\nyelp,Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.\\nyelp,I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.\\nyelp,\"For about 10 minutes, we we\\'re waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn\\'t coming any time soon.\"\\nyelp,\"Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.\"\\nyelp,Probably not in a hurry to go back.\\nyelp,It was probably dirt.\\nyelp,Waited and waited and waited.\\nyelp,The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!\\nyelp,Terrible service!\\nyelp,I wouldn\\'t return.\\nyelp,Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.\\nyelp,I don\\'t think I\\'ll be running back to Carly\\'s anytime soon for food.\\nyelp,It\\'s too bad the food is so damn generic.\\nyelp,This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.\\nyelp,Not good by any stretch of the imagination.\\nyelp,\"The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don\\'t mind being nude for everyone to see!\"\\nyelp,\"In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.\"\\nyelp,very slow at seating even with reservation.\\nyelp,Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.\\nyelp,\"The burger... I got the \"\"Gold Standard\"\" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.\"\\nyelp,The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.\\nyelp,We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!\\nyelp,She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.\\nyelp,It was packed!!\\nyelp,\"I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.\"\\nyelp,If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.\\nyelp,The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.\\nyelp,\"REAL sushi lovers, let\\'s be honest - Yama is not that good.\"\\nyelp,I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.\\nyelp,Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I\\'ll be back unless someone else is buying.\\nyelp,We will not be coming back.\\nyelp,\"We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.\"\\nyelp,My girlfriend\\'s veal was very bad.\\nyelp,I\\'m probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.\\nyelp,Mediocre food.\\nyelp,We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.\\nyelp,WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.\\nyelp,Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn\\'t want to eat it for fear of getting sick.\\nyelp,The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.\\nyelp,My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.\\nyelp,The service was a bit lacking.\\nyelp,\"a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.\"\\nyelp,\"Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.\"\\nyelp,We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.\\nyelp,I just don\\'t know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.\\nyelp,We won\\'t be going back.\\nyelp,\"He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.\"\\nyelp,We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.\\nyelp,\"The service was terrible, food was mediocre.\"\\nyelp,Don\\'t bother coming here.\\nyelp,\"Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.\"\\nyelp,\"Third, the cheese on my friend\\'s burger was cold.\"\\nyelp,\"The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.\"\\nyelp,\"The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an \"\"Are you being helped?\"\"\"\\nyelp,The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don\\'t always honor Pizza Hut coupons.\\nyelp,Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won\\'t be going back.\\nyelp,The worst was the salmon sashimi.\\nyelp,Would not recommend to others.\\nyelp,Don\\'t do it!!!!\\nyelp,It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.\\nyelp,I\\'m not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.\\nyelp,\"What did bother me, was the slow service.\"\\nyelp,\"i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?\"\\nyelp,I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.\\nyelp,Not my thing.\\nyelp,This place lacked style!!\\nyelp,I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.\\nyelp,Service sucks.\\nyelp,I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.\\nyelp,Nothing special.\\nyelp,The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.\\nyelp,\"The chains, which I\\'m no fan of, beat this place easily.\"\\nyelp,\"for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.\"\\nyelp,Overpriced for what you are getting.\\nyelp,Spend your money and time some place else.\\nyelp,\"I probably won\\'t be back, to be honest.\"\\nyelp,I\\'ll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.\\nyelp,the presentation of the food was awful.\\nyelp,First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!\\nyelp,\"Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.\"\\nyelp,I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.\\nyelp,Tasted like dirt.\\nyelp,Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.\\nyelp,\"I go to far too many places and I\\'ve never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.\"\\nyelp,It kept getting worse and worse so now I\\'m officially done.\\nyelp,I don\\'t think we\\'ll be going back anytime soon.\\nyelp,I would not recommend this place.\\nyelp,My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn\\'t look too appealing.\\nyelp,Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.\\nyelp,TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.\\nyelp,\"I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn\\'t use my common sense.\"\\nyelp,I will not return.\\nyelp,\"However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.\"\\nyelp,\"Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.\"\\nyelp,It was pretty gross!\\nyelp,\"Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(\"\\nyelp,\"Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.\"\\nyelp,The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn\\'t worth it.\\nyelp,Very poor service.\\nyelp,The management is rude.\\nyelp,Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid\\'s meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.\\nyelp,Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.\\nyelp,\"I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.\"\\nyelp,\"Main thing I didn\\'t enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.\"\\nyelp,\"The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.\"\\nyelp,I won\\'t be back.\\nyelp,The real disappointment was our waiter.\\nyelp,I was so insulted.\\nyelp,What happened next was pretty....off putting.\\nyelp,Service stinks here!\\nyelp,Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.\\nyelp,The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.\\nyelp,I probably would not go here again.\\nyelp,The RI style calamari was a joke.\\nyelp,If someone orders two tacos don\\'t\\' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?\\nyelp,-My order was not correct.\\nyelp,\"The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.\"\\nyelp,Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.\\nyelp,\"The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.\"\\nyelp,It wasn\\'t busy at all and now we know why.\\nyelp,And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn\\'t very tasty to me.\\nyelp,\"I could barely stomach the meal, but didn\\'t complain because it was a business lunch.\"\\nyelp,\"Furthermore, you can\\'t even find hours of operation on the website!\"\\nyelp,I dressed up to be treated so rudely!\\nyelp,I consider this theft.\\nyelp,I\\'m not impressed with the concept or the food.\\nyelp,Ryan\\'s Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won\\'t be revisiting.\\nyelp,Don\\'t waste your time here.\\nyelp,\"Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.\"\\nyelp,I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.\\nyelp,RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.\\nyelp,\"The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.\"\\nyelp,After two I felt disgusting.\\nyelp,Food was below average.\\nyelp,\"Very, very sad.\"\\nyelp,Con: spotty service.\\nyelp,\"Needless to say, I won\\'t be going back anytime soon.\"\\nyelp,WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.\\nyelp,\"(It wasn\\'t busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.\"\\nyelp,Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.\\nyelp,\"The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.\"\\nyelp,Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.\\nyelp,For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.\\nyelp,So don\\'t go there if you are looking for good food...\\nyelp,The ambiance isn\\'t much better.\\nyelp,\"The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.\"\\nyelp,\"Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!\"\\nyelp,I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.\\nyelp,I was mortified.\\nyelp,\"The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.\"\\nyelp,After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.\\nyelp,Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.\\nyelp,Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.\\nyelp,We waited for forty five minutes in vain.\\nyelp,I\\'m super pissd.\\nyelp,\"And the drinks are WEAK, people!\"\\nyelp,I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.\\nyelp,Very disappointing!!!\\nyelp,The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).\\nyelp,The plantains were the worst I\\'ve ever tasted.\\nyelp,\"They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don\\'t enjoy their food.\"\\nyelp,\"I don\\'t know what the big deal is about this place, but I won\\'t be back \"\"ya\\'all\"\".\"\\nyelp,But I definitely would not eat here again.\\nyelp,It really is impressive that the place hasn\\'t closed down.\\nyelp,The turkey and roast beef were bland.\\nyelp,This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.\\nyelp,If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!\\nyelp,Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to
