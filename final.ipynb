The bag of words model usually has a large list, probably better thought of as a sort of \"dictionary,\" which are considered to be words that carry sentiment. These words each have their own \"value\" when found in text. The values are typically all added up and the result is a sentiment valuation. The equation to add and derive a number can vary, but this model mainly focuses on the words, and makes no attempt to actually understand language fundamentals.\n",

you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.  \"\\nimdb,\"The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most

forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn\\'t.  \"\\nimdb,Exceptionally bad!  \\nimdb,\"But the convoluted plot just didn\\'t convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  \"\\nimdb,\"But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.  \"\\nimdb,At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  \\nimdb,\"But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn\\'t translate to quality, that\\'s for sure.  \"\\nimdb,When

story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  \"\\nimdb,\"To sum the film up, \"\"Breeders\"\" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.  \"\\nimdb,\"Wow, what a bad film.  \"\\nimdb,\"Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.  \"\\nimdb,& That movie was bad.  \\nimdb,\"IMDB ratings only go as low 1

derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  \"\\nimdb,\"A truly, truly bad film.  \"\\nimdb,The directing seems too pretentious.  \\nimdb,\"But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  \"\\nimdb,Summary: The witticisms weren\\'t witty.  \\nimdb,Avoid at any and all costs.  \\nimdb,\"The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling,

me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.  \"\\nimdb,The story is beyond stupid.  \\nimdb,The characters were very \\'stagey\\' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  \\nimdb,It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  \\nimdb,I was very disappointed in the movie.  \\nimdb,The visual effects were AWFUL.  \\nimdb,All in all its an insult to one\\'s intelligence and a huge waste of money.  \\nimdb,End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I\\'ve ever seen.  \\nimdb,This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  \\nimdb,1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  \\nimdb,The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.  \\nimdb,I\\'m translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  \\nimdb,\"Not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.  \"\\nimdb,It\\'s so bad it\\'s actually worth seeing just for that reason.  \\nimdb,\"The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv\\'s diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  \"\\nimdb,there is no real plot.  \\nimdb,The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  \\nimdb,\"The sets are so bad, they wouldn\\'t look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  \"\\nimdb,There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  \\nimdb,\"I don\\'t understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it\\'s not even a real movie!  \"\\nimdb,The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  \\nimdb,\"A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  \"\\nimdb,It is not good.  \\nimdb,The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  \\nimdb,You\\'d have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  \\nimdb,If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  \\nimdb,\"I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  \"\\nimdb,The concert sequences just sucked.  \\nimdb,Also the story and acting were weak.  \\nimdb,Everything about this movie is stupid.  \\nimdb,I literally vomited while watching this film.  \\nimdb,\"Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  \"\\nimdb,\"If this premise sound stupid, that\\'s because it is.  \"\\nimdb,\"The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???  \"\\nimdb,The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  \\nimdb,But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  \\nimdb,The film looks cheap and bland.  \\nimdb,I mean this in a terrible way.  \\nimdb,\"Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  \"\\nimdb,I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  \\nimdb,\"This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  \"\\nimdb,\"In a word, it is embarrassing.  \"\\nimdb,\"In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  \"\\nimdb,The plot is nonsense that doesn\\'t interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.  \\nimdb,I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  \\nimdb,And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  \\nimdb,\"I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.  \"\\nimdb,\"Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.  \"\\nimdb,\"These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  \"\\nimdb,It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I\\'d have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  \\nimdb,Avoid at ALL costs!  \\nimdb,What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  \\nimdb,Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  \\nimdb,I couldn\\'t take them seriously.  \\nimdb,\"About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  \"\\nimdb,Horrible!  \\nimdb,The directing is sloppy at best.  \\nimdb,\"There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn\\'t understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  \"\\nimdb,\"If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.  \"\\nimdb,\"And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would\\'ve been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  \"\\nimdb,Too politically correct.  \\nimdb,\"I wasn\\'t expecting Oscar material, but this?  \"\\nimdb,Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.  \\nimdb,The jerky camera movements were also annoying.  \\nimdb,A bit predictable.  \\nimdb,(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.  \\nimdb,\"Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  \"\\nimdb,I wasn\\'t the least bit interested.  \\nimdb,The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  \\nimdb,I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!  \\nimdb,From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  \\nimdb,\"This is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.  \"\\nimdb,The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  \\nimdb,Highly unrecommended.  \\nimdb,\"Let\\'s start with all the problems\\xc2\\x97the acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  \"\\nimdb,\"It\\'s an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  \"\\nimdb,Filmiing was less expansive.  \\nimdb,I\\'m so sorry but I really can\\'t recommend it to anyone.  \\nimdb,Watching washing machine twirling around wouldn\\'t hurt your eyes as much as this show.  \\nimdb,The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  \\nimdb,\"I\\'m glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn\\'t do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It\\'s gonna help movie makers who aren\\'t in the very restrained \"\"movie business\"\" of Qu\\xc3\\xa9bec.  \"\\nimdb,There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  \\nimdb,I never walked out of a movie faster.  \\nimdb,He surely doesn\\'t know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  \\nimdb,\"By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.  \"\\nimdb,\"I know that Jim O\\'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  \"\\nimdb,You can find better movies at youtube.  \\nimdb,THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  \\nimdb,\"How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it\\'s ALL wrong.  \"\\nimdb,This is definitely one of the bad ones.  \\nimdb,\"Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  \"\\nimdb,\"The plot doesn\\'t hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  \"\\nimdb,\"Lewis Black\\'s considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won\\'t allow.  \"\\nimdb,Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.  \\nimdb,\"His co-stars don\\'t fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  \"\\nimdb,This one just fails to create any real suspense.  \\nimdb,\"Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  \"\\nimdb,This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  \\nimdb,An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  \\nimdb,\"Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  \"\\nimdb,\"The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that\\'s how bad it is.  \"\\nimdb,One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  \\nimdb,There\\'s also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  \\nimdb,\"The \"\"explosion\"\" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.  \"\\nimdb,\"Another thing I didn\\'t really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  \"\\nimdb,It\\'s a case of \\'so bad it is laughable\\'.  \\nimdb,\"This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn\\'t have even been created.  \"\\nimdb,\"Aside from it\\'s terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  \"\\nimdb,I can\\'t believe there\\'s even a sequel to this!  \\nimdb,So bad...well...it\\'s just bad.  \\nimdb,\"This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  \"\\nimdb,\"Only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations MAYBE, & poor hummh!  \"\\nimdb,The poor actors.  \\nimdb,Then the film just dropped the ball.  \\nimdb,But even the talented Carrell can\\'t save this.  \\nimdb,I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I\\'d spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  \\nimdb,The least said about the acting the better.  \\nimdb,\"At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  \"\\nimdb,\"Worse, there\\'s an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who\\'s working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  \"\\nimdb,I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don\\'t believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  \\nimdb,\"Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.  \"\\nimdb,\"Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  \"\\nimdb,It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  \\nimdb,The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  \\nimdb,That\\'s how I\\'d describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.  \\nimdb,The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God\\'s sake!  \\nimdb,The lead man is charisma-free.  \\nimdb,\"Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  \"\\nimdb,It will drive you barking mad!  \\nimdb,It is shameful.  \\nimdb,It\\'s a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  \\nimdb,I thought it was bad.  \\nimdb,Nothing new there.  \\nimdb,I am a fan of his ... This movie sucked really bad.  \\nimdb,\"In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  \"\\nimdb,But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn\\'t really work for their freedom.  \\nimdb,\"first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  \"\\nimdb,I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  \\nimdb,\"He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  \"\\nimdb,Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  \\nimdb,There were too many close ups.  \\nimdb,\"Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  \"\\nimdb,\"On the negative, it\\'s insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  \"\\nimdb,\"You can\\'t relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  \"\\nimdb,\"Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.  \"\\nimdb,The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  \\nimdb,\"This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn\\'t work here.  \"\\nimdb,The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.  \\nimdb,I was left shattered from the experience of watching this \\'film\\' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  \\nimdb,\"The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80\\'s flicks.  \"\\nimdb,\"Often the dialogue doesn\\'t really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  \"\\nimdb,The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  \\nimdb,\"The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  \"\\nimdb,\"It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  \"\\nimdb,If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  \\nimdb,This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.  \\nimdb,I hate movies like that.  \\nimdb,\"He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  \"\\nimdb,\"Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  \"\\nimdb,What the hell kind of crap is that?!  \\nimdb,I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  \\nimdb,Started watching this but didn\\'t believe in any of the characters.  \\nimdb,\"The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  \"\\nimdb,It\\'s very slow.  \\nimdb,\"1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  \"\\nimdb,\"All in all, a great disappointment.  \"\\nimdb,The most annoying thing about \\'Cover Girl\\' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  \\nimdb,\"So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I\\'ve seen.  \"\\nimdb,This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  \\nimdb,Very little music or anything to speak of.  \\nimdb,The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.  \\nimdb,Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  \\nimdb,\"It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  \"\\nimdb,\"I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  \"\\nimdb,It\\'s like a bad two hour TV movie.  \\nimdb,But it wasn\\'t anything at all just one big yawn...  \\nimdb,\"Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  \"\\nimdb,Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  \\nimdb,\"Again, no plot at all.  \"\\nimdb,I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  \\nimdb,Not recommended.  \\nimdb,\"Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  \"\\nimdb,\"Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  \"\\nimdb,\"A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clich\\xc3\\xa9s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.  \"\\nimdb,The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.  \\nimdb,It just blew.  \\nimdb,There aren\\'t death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  \\nimdb,i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  \\nimdb,\"Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.  \"\\nimdb,None of them are engaging or exciting.  \\nimdb,\"The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  \"\\nimdb,\"Of course, the acting is blah.  \"\\nimdb,Lots of holes in the script.  \\nimdb,I\\'ll even say it again \\xc2\\x96 this is torture.  \\nimdb,You can\\'t even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  \\nimdb,The dialogue sucked.  \\nimdb,Very disappointing.  \\nimdb,The guy who said he\\'s had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  \\nimdb,Why was this film made?

 \\nimdb,The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  \\nimdb,I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  \\nimdb,My rating: just 3 out of 10.  \\nimdb,Dee Snider just plain sucks.  \\nimdb,The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen\\'t bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn\\'t care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  \\nimdb,\"There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn\\'t really work into the rest of the plot.  \"\\nimdb,Hated it.  \\nimdb,The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  \\nimdb,But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  \\nimdb,\"So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  \"\\nimdb,\"Even Billy Bob couldn\\'t rise above the script, which was worse.  \"\\nimdb,Rating: 1 out of 10.  \\nimdb,It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.  \\nimdb,\"He really didn\\'t seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn\\'t get involved with the guests.  \"\\nimdb,By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn\\'t care what happened next and so I switched off.  \\nimdb,This may be the only bad film he ever made.  \\nimdb,\"With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  \"\\nimdb,\"It was forced, like everything in this movie.  \"\\nimdb,I don\\'t think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  \\nimdb,In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  \\nimdb,Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  \\nimdb,\"The plot - well, I said I\\'d let that one go.  \"\\nimdb,Everything about it is just bad.  \\nimdb,Nothing at all to recommend.  \\nimdb,Didn\\'t laugh or even smile once.  \\nimdb,Really bad.  \\nimdb,Not easy to watch.  \\nimdb,This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.  \\nimdb,\"A Lassie movie which should have been \"\"put to sleep\"\".... FOREVER.  \"\\nimdb,So bad.  \\nimdb,Lot of holes in the plot: there\\'s nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  \\nimdb,\"Otherwise, don\\'t even waste your time on this.  \"\\nimdb,\"But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  \"\\nimdb,\"Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  \"\\nimdb,\"If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  \"\\nimdb,His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  \\nimdb,This was a flick doomed from its conception.  \\nimdb,I paid too much.  \\nimdb,This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.  \\nimdb,\"If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you\\'re gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  \"\\nimdb,It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  \\nimdb,Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  \\nimdb,\"I\\'m terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  \"\\nimdb,\"The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  \"\\nimdb,\"I am so tired of clich\\xc3\\xa9s that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.  \"\\nimdb,\"This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  \"\\nimdb,Lame would be the best way to describe it.  \\nimdb,\"It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  \"\\nimdb,I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  \\nimdb,Today the graphics are crap.  \\nimdb,\"The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  \"\\nimdb,The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  \\nimdb,About half way through this film I started to dislike it.  \\nimdb,\"Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie \"\"Grim\"\", clearly doesn\\'t know how to pace his films.  \"\\nimdb,\"Seriously, it\\'s not worth wasting your, or your kid\\'s time on.  \"\\nimdb,And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  \\nimdb,Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  \\nimdb,\"Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  \"\\nimdb,\"The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they\\'re delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  \"\\nimdb,\"It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.  \"\\nimdb,\"Long, whiny and pointless.  \"\\nimdb,I\\'m not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  \\nimdb,Omit watching this.  \\nimdb,This is not movie-making.  \\nimdb,The dialogue is atrocious.  \\nimdb,\"It probably would have been better if the director hadn\\'t spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn\\'t that noteworthy.  \"\\nimdb,\"To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it\\'s your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it\\'s in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  \"\\nimdb,\"putting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa\\'s character.  \"\\nimdb,The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  \\nimdb,The budget was evidently very limited.  \\nimdb,\"As for the killer, don\\'t expect anything original or even remotely frightening.  \"\\nimdb,\"Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.  \"\\nimdb,\"Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  \"\\nimdb,\"Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  \"\\nimdb,I\\'ve seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  \\nimdb,But it\\'s just not funny.  \\nimdb,\"I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  \"\\nimdb,The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  \\nimdb,\"I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  \"\\nimdb,\"Woa, talk about awful.  \"\\nimdb,All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  \\nimdb,The story line is totally predictable.  \\nimdb,Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  \\nimdb,It was so BORING!  \\nimdb,Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  \\nimdb,There were several moments in the movie that just didn\\'t need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  \\nimdb,The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  \\nimdb,\"\"\" But \"\"Storm Trooper\"\" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.  \"\\nimdb,\"The script is bad, very bad \\xc2\\x96 it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.  \"\\nimdb,This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  \\nimdb,The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  \\nimdb,This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  \\nimdb,\"Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  \"\\nimdb,Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  \\nimdb,The script is a big flawed mess.  \\nimdb,\"Unless you\\'re just out to visually \"\"collect\"\" all extant films of Austen\\'s work, you can skip this one.  \"\\nimdb,\"Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  \"\\nimdb,It was just too horrible.  \\nimdb,The lighting is awful.  \\nimdb,\"Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  \"\\nimdb,\"Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.  \"\\nimdb,\"Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  \"\\nimdb,I\\'m still trying to get over how bad it was.  \\nimdb,\"Camerawork - again, bad.  \"\\nimdb,About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  \\nimdb,\"Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  \"\\nimdb,\"And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  \"\\nimdb,\"It\\'s dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  \"\\nimdb,There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  \\nimdb,\"The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it\\'s about emptiness, it works I guess because it\\'s empty.  \"\\nimdb,\"Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  \"\\nimdb,It is zillion times away from reality.  \\nimdb,This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich\\xc3\\xa9s to be admitted elsewhere.  \\nimdb,I can\\'t see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  \\nimdb,\"But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as \"\"pretentious crap\"\".  \"\\nimdb,The movie seemed a little slow at first.  \\nimdb,It was horrendous.  \\nimdb,The soundtrack sucked.  \\nimdb,\"This was a poor remake of \"\"My Best Friends Wedding\"\".  \"\\nimdb,\"The results, well, are a shame.  \"\\nimdb,Everything stinks.  \\nimdb,It is an insane game.  \\nimdb,Now you know why I gave it a 10+!  \\nimdb,\"In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  \"\\nimdb,Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.  \\nimdb,This is high adventure at its best.  \\nimdb,\"Okay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I\\'ll give credit where credit\\'s due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  \"\\nimdb,\"If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne\\'s sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  \"\\nimdb,Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.  \\nimdb,The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.  \\nimdb,Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  \\nimdb,The film\\'s sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  \\nimdb,GO AND SEE IT!  \\nimdb,I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  \\nimdb,\"It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  \"\\nimdb,\"I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973, when it was \"\"The Stranger\"\" and I loved it.  \"\\nimdb,I rate this movie 9/10.  \\nimdb,The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  \\nimdb,I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.  \\nimdb,\"Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  \"\\nimdb,\"Yet, I enjoy watching it.  \"\\nimdb,It\\'s one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!  \\nimdb,\"Gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!  \"\\nimdb,\"(My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.  \"\\nimdb,\"An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  \"\\nimdb,\"Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  \"\\nimdb,\"I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  \"\\nimdb,\"If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of \"\"The Way You Look Tonight\"\"), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  \"\\nimdb,\"Still, it was the SETS that got a big \"\"10\"\" on my \"\"oy-vey\"\" scale.  \"\\nimdb,\"Funny, clever, hip - just like Pray\\'s previous film, Hype!  \"\\nimdb,This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  \\nimdb,The camera really likes her in this movie.  \\nimdb,It\\'s hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  \\nimdb,\"The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  \"\\nimdb,\"Predictable, but not a bad watch.  \"\\nimdb,\"The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture\\'s disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it\\'s distorted interpretations of fame.  \"\\nimdb,The movie is not completely perfect but \\'Titta Di Girolamo\\' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  \\nimdb,I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  \\nimdb,\"The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.  \"\\nimdb,\"Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.  \"\\nimdb,The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  \\nimdb,\"This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  \"\\nimdb,\"Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.  \"\\nimdb,\"However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film \"\"about\"\" Mishima that is both superb & complex.  \"\\nimdb,But in terms of the writing it\\'s very fresh and bold.  \\nimdb,\"But it is entertaining, nonetheless.  \"\\nimdb,\"steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy.  \"\\nimdb,The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  \\nimdb,How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  \\nimdb,\"Totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.  \"\\nimdb,\"If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  \"\\nimdb,You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  \\nimdb,\"The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I\\'ve seen.  \"\\nimdb,\"Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  \"\\nimdb,The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  \\nimdb,\") some great music, and terrific scenery.  \"\\nimdb,\"The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn\\'t make it.  \"\\nimdb,I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.  \\nimdb,But this movie really got to me.  \\nimdb,\") What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.  \"\\nimdb,is pretty funny.  \\nimdb,\"There is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).  \"\\nimdb,\"The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.  \"\\nimdb,Her role was played well.  \\nimdb,That was nice.  \\nimdb,\"For people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job!!  \"\\nimdb,\"This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it\\'s not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  \"\\nimdb,\"At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar\\'s CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  \"\\nimdb,\"I have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.  \"\\nimdb,\"Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  \"\\nimdb,All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola\\'s roeg wih a sublime cast.  \\nimdb,I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.  \\nimdb,\"The ending is so, SO perfect... you\\'ll shed a tear.  \"\\nimdb,The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  \\nimdb,\"In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  \"\\nimdb,Also notable is John Bailey\\'s fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola\\'s Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  \\nimdb,Ursula Burton\\'s portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  \\nimdb,\"However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  \"\\nimdb,Great movie!  \\nimdb,It looked like a wonderful story.  \\nimdb,\"Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in \"\"At Play In The Fields Of The Lord\"\".  \"\\nimdb,You share General Loewenhielm\\'s exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  \\nimdb,Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  \\nimdb,The cast is good.  \\nimdb,The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.  \\nimdb,\"Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens\\' Christmas Carol in its sensibility.  \"\\nimdb,The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  \\nimdb,This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.  \\nimdb,\"Excellent cast, story line, performances.  \"\\nimdb,\"Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel\\'s discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer\\'s grasp in Huston\\'s portrayal.  \"\\nimdb,It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  \\nimdb,She\\'s poised and amazing.  \\nimdb,There still are good actors around!  \\nimdb,And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  \\nimdb,I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!  \\nimdb,Julian Fellowes has triumphed again.  \\nimdb,You won\\'t forget this movie!  \\nimdb,Three of the most visually appealing movies i\\'ve ever seen.  \\nimdb,\"I like Armand Assante & my cable company\\'s summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  \"\\nimdb,It was so funny.  \\nimdb,\"If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  \"\\nimdb,This if the first movie I\\'ve given a 10 to in years.  \\nimdb,I advise you to look out for it.  \\nimdb,\"I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  \"\\nimdb,\"Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  \"\\nimdb,\"The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn\\'t insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  \"\\nimdb,\"I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  \"\\nimdb,\"Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  \"\\nimdb,\"I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)  \"\\nimdb,Definitely worth seeing\\xc2\\x85 it\\'s the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  \\nimdb,\"The film\\'s dialogue is natural, real to life.  \"\\nimdb,;) Recommend with confidence!  \\nimdb,I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.  \\nimdb,PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.  \\nimdb,Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  \\nimdb,\"As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980\\'s and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.  \"\\nimdb,\"It\\'s just adorable seeing Mickey playing \"\"Turkey in the Straw\"\" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  \"\\nimdb,\"It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone\\'s terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  \"\\nimdb,Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.  \\nimdb,\"But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you\\'ll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  \"\\nimdb,A great film by a great director.  \\nimdb,Don\\'t miss it.  \\nimdb,\"I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez\\'s directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  \"\\nimdb,Brilliant!  \\nimdb,\"While you don\\'t yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  \"\\nimdb,The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  \\nimdb,\"Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock\\'s black and white, low-budget original.  \"\\nimdb,This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  \\nimdb,It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients\\' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).  \\nimdb,Conclusion - I loved it.  \\nimdb,This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  \\nimdb,Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  \\nimdb,\"The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the \"\"acting coach\"\" are fascinating.  \"\\nimdb,John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  \\nimdb,It\\'s PURE BRILLIANCE.  \\nimdb,The movie I received was a great quality film for it\\'s age.  \\nimdb,\"It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the \"\"gadget\"\".  \"\\nimdb,I will never forget it now.  \\nimdb,A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.  \\nimdb,Also great directing and photography.  \\nimdb,The movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!  \\nimdb,\"It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.  \"\\nimdb,Definitely worth checking out.  \\nimdb,\"This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.  \"\\nimdb,For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki\\'s films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.  \\nimdb,\"Plus, with the movie\\'s rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  \"\\nimdb,I have recommended it to friends.  \\nimdb,Up there with the best of Melville.  \\nimdb,Waste your money on this game.  \\nimdb,\"Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  \"\\nimdb,\"It\\'s a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  \"\\nimdb,This is an extraordinary film.  \\nimdb,Babie Bop is very cute.  \\nimdb,An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  \\nimdb,They could be used as exemplars for any set designer.  \\nimdb,Go rent it.  \\nimdb,I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  \\nimdb,\"I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  \"\\nimdb,Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  \\nimdb,\"Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.  \"\\nimdb,10 out of 10 stars.  \\nimdb,Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master\\'s stable.  \\nimdb,This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.  \\nimdb,But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  \\nimdb,\"Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  \"\\nimdb,This movie has a cutting edge to it.  \\nimdb,\"I found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.  \"\\nimdb,\"***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can\\'t) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  \"\\nimdb,\"I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  \"\\nimdb,This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films.  \\nimdb,This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.  \\nimdb,Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I\\'ve ever heard.  \\nimdb,Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  \\nimdb,\"There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it\\'s just a massive game.  \"\\nimdb,But I thought his acting was skilled.  \\nimdb,This is an excellent film.  \\nimdb,\"When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  \"\\nimdb,This movie is also revealing.  \\nimdb,Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  \\nimdb,This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  \\nimdb,\"This movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven\\'t seen before.  \"\\nimdb,This is the number one best TH game in the series.  \\nimdb,I didn\\'t realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.  \\nimdb,This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  \\nimdb,Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  \\nimdb,I gave it a 10  \\nimdb,I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  \\nimdb,\"It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.  \"\\nimdb,The kids are very cool too.  \\nimdb,I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.  \\nimdb,I enjoyed it.  \\nimdb,\"It was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce\\'s acclaimed novella \"\"The Dead.  \"\\nimdb,It was also the right balance of war and love.  \\nimdb,Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  \\nimdb,This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.  \\nimdb,\"Emily Watson\\'s character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.  \"\\nimdb,I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  \\nimdb,\"And I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa Aurv\\xc3\\xa5g being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn\\'t understand where he is, what he is doing and why.  \"\\nimdb,The characters are interesting and you really care for them.  \\nimdb,See both films if you can.  \\nimdb,Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.  \\nimdb,\"Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  \"\\nimdb,\"I left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  \"\\nimdb,\"They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  \"\\nimdb,\"An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I\\'d love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  \"\\nimdb,The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  \\nimdb,I liked this movie way too much.  \\nimdb,The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.  \\nimdb,\"It was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.  \"\\nimdb,\"The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  \"\\nimdb,Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  \\nimdb,All the characters in this film are tremendously well played.  \\nimdb,\"Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  \"\\nimdb,Excellent short film.  \\nimdb,\"But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman \\xc2\\x96 and totally believable because he is a great actor.  \"\\nimdb,\"\"\" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  \"\\nimdb,His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  \\nimdb,Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.  \\nimdb,The transfers are very good.  \\nimdb,\"And there wasn\\'t a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  \"\\nimdb,This movie is so awesome!  \\nimdb,I\\'ll give this film 10 out of 10!  \\nimdb,I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  \\nimdb,It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  \\nimdb,\"It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  \"\\nimdb,It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  \\nimdb,\"The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  \"\\nimdb,\"\"\" In fact, it\\'s hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  \"\\nimdb,\"Being a 90\\'s child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  \"\\nimdb,\"In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise\\'s attempt.  \"\\nimdb,\"The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.  \"\\nimdb,\"It\\'s as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master\\'s work.  \"\\nimdb,Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  \\nimdb,\"Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  \"\\nimdb,This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70\\'s.  \\nimdb,The aerial scenes were well-done.  \\nimdb,Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.  \\nimdb,\"The film gives meaning to the phrase, \"\"Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.  \"\\nimdb,There is a brilliant twist ending.  \\nimdb,\"Lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.  \"\\nimdb,\"I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.  \"\\nimdb,It was a long time that i didn\\'t see a so charismatic actor on screen.  \\nimdb,Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.  \\nimdb,\"Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  \"\\nimdb,Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  \\nimdb,I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  \\nimdb,Meredith M was better than all right.  \\nimdb,I sat riveted to the TV screen.  \\nimdb,\"It\\'s a sad movie, but very good.  \"\\nimdb,\"If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director\\'s ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  \"\\nimdb,And those baby owls were adorable.  \\nimdb,\"This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA\\'s finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  \"\\nimdb,\"The soundtrack wasn\\'t terrible, either.  \"\\nimdb,He\\'s a national treasure.  \\nimdb,Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else\\'s judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  \\nimdb,This film offers many delights and surprises.  \\nimdb,The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.  \\nimdb,\"Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  \"\\nimdb,A good commentary of today\\'s love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.  \\nimdb,\"As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  \"\\nimdb,There\\'s barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  \\nimdb,\"As a courtroom drama, it\\'s compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it\\'s frightening.  \"\\nimdb,\"The acting, as you\\'d expect from this cast, is top notch.  \"\\nimdb,The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  \\nimdb,\"It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  \"\\nimdb,Raw and sublimely moving.  \\nimdb,It has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.  \\nimdb,\"the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  \"\\nimdb,\"He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  \"\\nimdb,\"Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  \"\\nimdb,It even has its sweet moments.  \\nimdb,\"Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  \"\\nimdb,This game rocks.  \\nimdb,10/10  \\nimdb,\"I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  \"\\nimdb,The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  \\nimdb,\"Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  \"\\nimdb,\"The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  \"\\nimdb,\"I won\\'t spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  \"\\nimdb,\"This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  \"\\nimdb,\"I couldn\\'t think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  \"\\nimdb,Everything about this film is simply incredible.  \\nimdb,I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  \\nimdb,Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi\\'s best producers Scot Vandiver !  \\nimdb,Very nice and relaxing late night viewing.  \\nimdb,\"\"\" I love it.  \"\\nimdb,\"The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  \"\\nimdb,Definitely worth checking out.  \\nimdb,STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  \\nimdb,The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  \\nimdb,Totally believable.  \\nimdb,\"This is a very \"\"right on case\"\" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  \"\\nimdb,Still it\\'s quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  \\nimdb,\"Shot in the Southern California desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkins creates a film like no other.  \"\\nimdb,\"Some applause should be given to the \"\"prelude\"\" however.  \"\\nimdb,\"The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  \"\\nimdb,The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.  \\nimdb,\"When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from \"\"Don Giovanni\"\" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.  \"\\nimdb,It\\'s also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn\\'t missed a step going from silent to sound.  \\nimdb,\":) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  \"\\nimdb,An excellent performance from Ms.  \\nimdb,\"People who like European films and \"\"art movies\"\" will like this movie.  \"\\nimdb,\"The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  \"\\nimdb,\"After watching this film, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.  \"\\nimdb,Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.  \\nimdb,\"If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  \"\\nimdb,\") a happy, wonderful, feel good ending!  \"\\nimdb,\"But \"\"Tiny Toons\"\" kept the 90\\'s vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  \"\\nimdb,It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  \\nimdb,\"A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  \"\\nimdb,Hitchcock is a great director.  \\nimdb,And I really did find them funny.  \\nimdb,A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  \\nimdb,Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey\\'s best films even after 80 wonderful years.  \\nimdb,I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.  \\nimdb,It is a true classic.  \\nimdb,Brilliance indeed.  \\nimdb,\"I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.  \"\\nimdb,\"All things considered, a job very well done.  \"\\nimdb,It really created a unique feeling though.  \\nimdb,\"The point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.  \"\\nimdb,This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  \\nimdb,All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  \\nimdb,Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  \\nimdb,The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  \\nimdb,Simply beautiful.  \\nimdb,It\\'s a feel-good film and that\\'s how I felt when I came out of the cinema!  \\nimdb,Excellent performance.  \\nimdb,\"I don\\'t know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family\\'s memories.  \"\\nimdb,You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  \\nimdb,The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  \\nimdb,\"Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America\\'s own Imperial age.  \"\\nimdb,\"Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  \"\\nimdb,See it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.  \\nimdb,Think of the film being like a dream.  \\nimdb,10/10  \\nimdb,Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.  \\nimdb,\"\"\" With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can\\'t recommend this movie enough.  \"\\nimdb,\"It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  \"\\nimdb,\"Still, I do like this movie for it\\'s empowerment of women; there\\'s not enough movies out there like this one.  \"\\nimdb,You wont regret it!  \\nimdb,\"If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  \"\\nimdb,\"Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  \"\\nimdb,\"I\\'m glad the film didn\\'t go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  \"\\nimdb,The music in the film is really nice too.  \\nimdb,I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  \\nimdb,The cast is always entertaining as usual.  \\nimdb,\"A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.  \"\\nimdb,Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY).  \\nimdb,\"Also, it\\'s a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.  \"\\nimdb,Give this one a look.  \\nimdb,Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  \\nimdb,The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.  \\nimdb,Fans of the genre will be in heaven.  \\nimdb,\"Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  \"\\nimdb,Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.  \\nimdb,But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut\\'s biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR.  \\nimdb,His performance is simply genius.  \\nimdb,His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  \\nimdb,This is such a fun and funny movie.  \\nimdb,It\\'s still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  \\nimdb,This is actually a very smart movie.  \\nimdb,There is a lot of beautiful places.  \\nimdb,\"But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  \"\\nimdb,I don\\'t think you will be disappointed.  \\nimdb,A good film by a great director!  \\nimdb,\"Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  \"\\nimdb,It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.  \\nimdb,This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.  \\nimdb,It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  \\nimdb,\"Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn\\'t seem to be stocking them.  \"\\nimdb,There are some generally great things in it.  \\nimdb,\"He owns the film, just as Spacek owned \"\"Coal Miner\\'s Daughter\"\" and Quaid owned \"\"Great Balls of Fire.  \"\\nimdb,\"For that, it\\'s worth checking out.  \"\\nimdb,\"It\\'s practically perfect in all of them \\xc2\\x96 a true masterpiece in a sea of faux \"\"masterpieces.  \"\\nimdb,\"Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery\\'s noble brigand, Candace Bergen\\'s feisty heroine, John Huston\\'s wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly\\'s spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt\\'s \"\"Big Stick\"\".  \"\\nimdb,\"I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of \"\"wonder\"\") are the excerpts from his works.  \"\\nimdb,The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  \\nimdb,Barney is definitely super DE duper.  \\nimdb,I just saw this film and I recommend it.  \\nimdb,It is a really good show to watch.  \\nimdb,\"Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  \"\\nimdb,\"All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  \"\\nimdb,In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  \\nimdb,Not too screamy not to masculine but just right.  \\nimdb,A film not easily forgotten.  \\nimdb,\"I loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it\\'s share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  \"\\nimdb,Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  \\nimdb,The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  \\nimdb,\"I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  \"\\nimdb,\"I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child.  \"\\nimdb,I\\'d advise anyone to go and see it.  \\nimdb,\"He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  \"\\nimdb,The rest of the cast also play well.  \\nimdb,\"The writers were \"\"smack on\"\" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real.  \"\\nimdb,The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  \\nimdb,Lange had become a great actress.  \\nimdb,I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  \\nimdb,I rather enjoyed it.  \\nimdb,I really liked that.  \\nimdb,It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn\\'t fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  \\nyelp,Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!\\nyelp,\"The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn\\'t eat here again.\"\\nyelp,Overall I wasn\\'t very impressed with Noca.\\nyelp,\"Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around

setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.\"\\nyelp,I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.\\nyelp,We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.\\nyelp,Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.\\nyelp,dont go here.\\nyelp,\"The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food

fail.\\nyelp,\"Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.\"\\nyelp,\"The food is about on par with Denny\\'s, which is to say, not good at all.\"\\nyelp,I will never go

well.\\nyelp,We\\'ll never go again.\\nyelp,Over rated.\\nyelp,My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.\\nyelp,\"Then, as if I hadn\\'t wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.\"\\nyelp,\"For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.\"\\nyelp,But then they came

descriptions said \"\"yum yum sauce\"\" and another said \"\"eel sauce\"\", yet another said \"\"spicy mayo\"\"...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.\"\\nyelp,Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.\\nyelp,We\\'ve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we

overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.\"\\nyelp,\"By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn\\'t mind making it publicly and loudly known.\"\\nyelp,\"There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better\"\\nyelp,I give it 2 thumbs down\\nyelp,Hell no will I go back\\nyelp,\"I had high hopes for this place

tasty and the texture was just nasty.\\nyelp,I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.\\nyelp,If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.\\nyelp,Do not waste your money here!\\nyelp,\"like the other reviewer said \"\"you couldn\\'t pay me to eat at this place again.\"\"\"\\nyelp,Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.\\nyelp,Boy was that sucker dry!!.\\nyelp,walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.\\nyelp,I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.\\nyelp,This place deserves no stars.\\nyelp,\"On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.\"\\nyelp,Worst food/service I\\'ve had in a while.\\nyelp,We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn\\'t bring that either.\\nyelp,It was equally awful.\\nyelp,After all the rave reviews I couldn\\'t wait to eat here......what a disappointment!\\nyelp,\"Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.\"\\nyelp,A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.\\nyelp,Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!\\nyelp,\"It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.\"\\nyelp,this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco\\'s.\\nyelp,I probably won\\'t be coming back here.\\nyelp,Terrible management.\\nyelp,\"seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.\"\\nyelp,My gyro was basically lettuce only.\\nyelp,\"I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!\"\\nyelp,Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.\\nyelp,I took back my money and got outta there.\\nyelp,Waiter was a jerk.\\nyelp,I wasn\\'t really impressed with Strip Steak.\\nyelp,\"It was extremely \"\"crumby\"\" and pretty tasteless.\"\\nyelp,\"Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.\"\\nyelp,\"Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.\"\\nyelp,\"Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.\"\\nyelp,\"Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I\\'ve ever had.\"\\nyelp,\"Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.\"\\nyelp,I\\'ve lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I\\'ve stepped foot into this place.\\nyelp,Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.\\nyelp,\"I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn\\'t food.\"\\nyelp,I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!\\nyelp,I would not recommend this place.\\nyelp,\"The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.\"\\nyelp,If you are reading this please don\\'t go there.\\nyelp,\"The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.\"\\nyelp,\"not even a \"\"hello, we will be right with you.\"\"\"\\nyelp,first time there and might just be the last.\\nyelp,Appetite instantly gone.\\nyelp,The service here is fair at best.\\nyelp,\"This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!\"\\nyelp,\"It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.\"\\nyelp,I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.\\nyelp,Won\\'t ever go here again.\\nyelp,The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.\\nyelp,The service was poor and thats being nice.\\nyelp,This place should honestly be blown up.\\nyelp,The service was meh.\\nyelp,The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.\\nyelp,I waited and waited.\\nyelp,The fried rice was dry as well.\\nyelp,This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.\\nyelp,We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.\\nyelp,My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.\\nyelp,\"At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn\\'t that busy.\"\\nyelp,This place is disgusting!\\nyelp,We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn\\'t fresh.\\nyelp,\"Sadly, Gordon Ramsey\\'s Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.\"\\nyelp,\"Will never, ever go back.\"\\nyelp,\"I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it\\'s so terrible!?!\"\\nyelp,Must have been an off night at this place.\\nyelp,\"The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.\"\\nyelp,\"Strike 2, who wants to be rushed.\"\\nyelp,\"I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.\"\\nyelp,They dropped more than the ball.\\nyelp,I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.\\nyelp,the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.\\nyelp,The waiter wasn\\'t helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.\\nyelp,Worst martini ever!\\nyelp,\"Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!\"\\nyelp,\"Overall, I don\\'t think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.\"\\nyelp,There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.\\nyelp,Which are small and not worth the price.\\nyelp,AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!\\nyelp,Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don\\'t want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I\\'ll leave it at that...\\nyelp,And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.\\nyelp,\"After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.\"\\nyelp,We aren\\'t ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don\\'t get it...definitely lost the love after this one!\\nyelp,Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.\\nyelp,I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.\\nyelp,\"For about 10 minutes, we we\\'re waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn\\'t coming any time soon.\"\\nyelp,\"Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.\"\\nyelp,Probably not in a hurry to go back.\\nyelp,It was probably dirt.\\nyelp,Waited and waited and waited.\\nyelp,The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!\\nyelp,Terrible service!\\nyelp,I wouldn\\'t return.\\nyelp,Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.\\nyelp,I don\\'t think I\\'ll be running back to Carly\\'s anytime soon for food.\\nyelp,It\\'s too bad the food is so damn generic.\\nyelp,This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.\\nyelp,Not good by any stretch of the imagination.\\nyelp,\"The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don\\'t mind being nude for everyone to see!\"\\nyelp,\"In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.\"\\nyelp,very slow at seating even with reservation.\\nyelp,Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.\\nyelp,\"The burger... I got the \"\"Gold Standard\"\" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.\"\\nyelp,The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.\\nyelp,We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!\\nyelp,She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.\\nyelp,It was packed!!\\nyelp,\"I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.\"\\nyelp,If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.\\nyelp,The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.\\nyelp,\"REAL sushi lovers, let\\'s be honest - Yama is not that good.\"\\nyelp,I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.\\nyelp,Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I\\'ll be back unless someone else is buying.\\nyelp,We will not be coming back.\\nyelp,\"We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.\"\\nyelp,My girlfriend\\'s veal was very bad.\\nyelp,I\\'m probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.\\nyelp,Mediocre food.\\nyelp,We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.\\nyelp,WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.\\nyelp,Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn\\'t want to eat it for fear of getting sick.\\nyelp,The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.\\nyelp,My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.\\nyelp,The service was a bit lacking.\\nyelp,\"a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.\"\\nyelp,\"Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.\"\\nyelp,We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.\\nyelp,I just don\\'t know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.\\nyelp,We won\\'t be going back.\\nyelp,\"He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.\"\\nyelp,We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.\\nyelp,\"The service was terrible, food was mediocre.\"\\nyelp,Don\\'t bother coming here.\\nyelp,\"Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.\"\\nyelp,\"Third, the cheese on my friend\\'s burger was cold.\"\\nyelp,\"The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.\"\\nyelp,\"The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an \"\"Are you being helped?\"\"\"\\nyelp,The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don\\'t always honor Pizza Hut coupons.\\nyelp,Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won\\'t be going back.\\nyelp,The worst was the salmon sashimi.\\nyelp,Would not recommend to others.\\nyelp,Don\\'t do it!!!!\\nyelp,It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.\\nyelp,I\\'m not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.\\nyelp,\"What did bother me, was the slow service.\"\\nyelp,\"i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?\"\\nyelp,I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.\\nyelp,Not my thing.\\nyelp,This place lacked style!!\\nyelp,I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.\\nyelp,Service sucks.\\nyelp,I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.\\nyelp,Nothing special.\\nyelp,The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.\\nyelp,\"The chains, which I\\'m no fan of, beat this place easily.\"\\nyelp,\"for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.\"\\nyelp,Overpriced for what you are getting.\\nyelp,Spend your money and time some place else.\\nyelp,\"I probably won\\'t be back, to be honest.\"\\nyelp,I\\'ll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.\\nyelp,the presentation of the food was awful.\\nyelp,First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!\\nyelp,\"Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.\"\\nyelp,I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.\\nyelp,Tasted like dirt.\\nyelp,Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.\\nyelp,\"I go to far too many places and I\\'ve never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.\"\\nyelp,It kept getting worse and worse so now I\\'m officially done.\\nyelp,I don\\'t think we\\'ll be going back anytime soon.\\nyelp,I would not recommend this place.\\nyelp,My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn\\'t look too appealing.\\nyelp,Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.\\nyelp,TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.\\nyelp,\"I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn\\'t use my common sense.\"\\nyelp,I will not return.\\nyelp,\"However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.\"\\nyelp,\"Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.\"\\nyelp,It was pretty gross!\\nyelp,\"Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(\"\\nyelp,\"Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.\"\\nyelp,The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn\\'t worth it.\\nyelp,Very poor service.\\nyelp,The management is rude.\\nyelp,Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid\\'s meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.\\nyelp,Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.\\nyelp,\"I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.\"\\nyelp,\"Main thing I didn\\'t enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.\"\\nyelp,\"The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.\"\\nyelp,I won\\'t be back.\\nyelp,The real disappointment was our waiter.\\nyelp,I was so insulted.\\nyelp,What happened next was pretty....off putting.\\nyelp,Service stinks here!\\nyelp,Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.\\nyelp,The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.\\nyelp,I probably would not go here again.\\nyelp,The RI style calamari was a joke.\\nyelp,If someone orders two tacos don\\'t\\' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?\\nyelp,-My order was not correct.\\nyelp,\"The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.\"\\nyelp,Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.\\nyelp,\"The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.\"\\nyelp,It wasn\\'t busy at all and now we know why.\\nyelp,And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn\\'t very tasty to me.\\nyelp,\"I could barely stomach the meal, but didn\\'t complain because it was a business lunch.\"\\nyelp,\"Furthermore, you can\\'t even find hours of operation on the website!\"\\nyelp,I dressed up to be treated so rudely!\\nyelp,I consider this theft.\\nyelp,I\\'m not impressed with the concept or the food.\\nyelp,Ryan\\'s Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won\\'t be revisiting.\\nyelp,Don\\'t waste your time here.\\nyelp,\"Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.\"\\nyelp,I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.\\nyelp,RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.\\nyelp,\"The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.\"\\nyelp,After two I felt disgusting.\\nyelp,Food was below average.\\nyelp,\"Very, very sad.\"\\nyelp,Con: spotty service.\\nyelp,\"Needless to say, I won\\'t be going back anytime soon.\"\\nyelp,WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.\\nyelp,\"(It wasn\\'t busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.\"\\nyelp,Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.\\nyelp,\"The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.\"\\nyelp,Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.\\nyelp,For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.\\nyelp,So don\\'t go there if you are looking for good food...\\nyelp,The ambiance isn\\'t much better.\\nyelp,\"The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.\"\\nyelp,\"Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!\"\\nyelp,I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.\\nyelp,I was mortified.\\nyelp,\"The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.\"\\nyelp,After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.\\nyelp,Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.\\nyelp,Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.\\nyelp,We waited for forty five minutes in vain.\\nyelp,I\\'m super pissd.\\nyelp,\"And the drinks are WEAK, people!\"\\nyelp,I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.\\nyelp,Very disappointing!!!\\nyelp,The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).\\nyelp,The plantains were the worst I\\'ve ever tasted.\\nyelp,\"They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don\\'t enjoy their food.\"\\nyelp,\"I don\\'t know what the big deal is about this place, but I won\\'t be back \"\"ya\\'all\"\".\"\\nyelp,But I definitely would not eat here again.\\nyelp,It really is impressive that the place hasn\\'t closed down.\\nyelp,The turkey and roast beef were bland.\\nyelp,This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.\\nyelp,If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!\\nyelp,Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.\\nyelp,Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.\\nyelp,The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.\\nyelp,\"Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.\"\\nyelp,\"I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.\"\\nyelp,\"The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he\\'s ever eaten.\"\\nyelp,5 stars for the brick oven bread app!\\nyelp,Each day of the week they have a different deal and it\\'s all so delicious!\\nyelp,I had a pretty satifying experience.\\nyelp,\"Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative.\"\\nyelp,This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.\\nyelp,\"Love the margaritas, too!\"\\nyelp,\"The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.\"\\nyelp,It was delicious!!!\\nyelp,So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.\\nyelp,Have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!!\\nyelp,\"Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!\"\\nyelp,And service was super friendly.\\nyelp,Bacon is hella salty.\\nyelp,Damn good steak.\\nyelp,\"For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.\"\\nyelp,\"Oh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant.\"\\nyelp,This place has it!\\nyelp,I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.\\nyelp,Wow very spicy but delicious.\\nyelp,Everything was good and tasty!\\nyelp,\"If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch

spot.\\nyelp,It is worth the drive.\\nyelp,Food was great and so was the serivce!\\nyelp,\"That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased.\"\\nyelp,Check it out.\\nyelp,(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)\\nyelp,By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!\\nyelp,My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.\\nyelp,\"They will customize your order any way you\\'d like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!\"\\nyelp,The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.\\nyelp,\"I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.\"\\nyelp,The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\nyelp,\"I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza.\"\\nyelp,\"The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.\"\\nyelp,One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .\\nyelp,It\\'ll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!\\nyelp,I love their fries and their beans.\\nyelp,Def coming back to bowl next time\\nyelp,They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.\\nyelp,They were excellent.\\nyelp,I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.\\nyelp,Will be back again!\\nyelp,this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.\\nyelp,The staff was very attentive.\\nyelp,And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).\\nyelp,Highly recommended.\\nyelp,So absolutley fantastic.\\nyelp,The shrimp tender and moist.\\nyelp,Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.\\nyelp,I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.\\nyelp,Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.\\nyelp,This is a GREAT place to eat!\\nyelp,\"Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time.\"\\nyelp,That\\'s right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.\\nyelp,We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.\\nyelp,Good prices.\\nyelp,\"The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.\"\\nyelp,The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.\\nyelp,\"Give it a try, you will be happy you did.\"\\nyelp,Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!\\nyelp,\"After one bite, I was hooked.\"\\nyelp,Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.\\nyelp,My drink was

in a while.\"\\nyelp,The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.\\nyelp,Sooooo good!!\\nyelp,All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!\\nyelp,\"This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly

your mouth fresh.\\nyelp,This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.\\nyelp,\"I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.\"\\nyelp,I love this place.\\nyelp,I can assure you that you won\\'t be disappointed.\\nyelp,\"Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.\"\\nyelp,\"Not to mention the combination

        "*  The procedure has a single parameter called k that refers to the number of groups that a given data sample is to be split into. As such, the procedure is often called k-fold cross-validation. When a specific value for k is chosen, it may be used in place of k in the reference to the model, such as k=10 becoming 10-fold cross-validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "*  Cross-validation is primarily used in applied machine learning to estimate the skill of a machine learning model on unseen data. That is, to use a limited sample in order to estimate how the model is expected to perform in general when used to make predictions on data not used during the training of the model.\n",
        "\n",
